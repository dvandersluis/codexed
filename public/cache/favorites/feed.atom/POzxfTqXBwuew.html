    <title>QFT Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world is ending Saturday. Guess I should skip work, smoke weed, and listen to Marley. Fuck, I was going to do that anyway.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/05/18/armageddon"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If wishes were the answer,&lt;br/&gt;
I'd pull down some shooting stars&lt;br/&gt;
to captivate behind your eyes&lt;br/&gt;
like fireflies in jars.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;A href="http://poetymology.codexed.com/2011/05/18/lullaby-on-the-brink-of-travel"&gt;Poetymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these letters&lt;br/&gt;
held together, &lt;br/&gt;
sticky adhesive of&lt;br/&gt;
cultural recognition.&lt;br/&gt;
assembled like a puzzle &lt;br/&gt;
awarding a new &lt;br/&gt;
contemporary meaning&lt;br/&gt;
to a tired old refrain.&lt;br/&gt;
RE &#8211; FRAIN&lt;br/&gt;
RE &#8211; FRAME&lt;br/&gt;
make it new again&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bellwether.codexed.com/2011/05/18/before"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;crisscrossing each surface like the plash of a fishnet--for when there is nothing left to show, there will still be something left to gather up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://confluence.codexed.com/2011/05/13/alderney-stones"&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not that I depend on these things to write, it&#8217;s just that my mind is too busy renormalizing itself to efficiently think in a creatively satisfying way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://octo7.codexed.com/2011/05/17/untitled"&gt;Octo7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bland. false.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://clayfui.codexed.com/2011/05/12/kneaded-erasers"&gt;Clayfui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely thought that by exposing my clumsy ruminations to a blank page (and, to a lesser extent, some small sort of audience), there was the slightest chance it might be one way to help me make sense of it all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/05/17/shame-on-me"&gt;Folkjokeopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a placeholder. That's really all I wanted to say.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morsmordre.codexed.com/2011/05/13/a-bookmark"&gt;Morsmordre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be (more) melodramatic and say that I'd like to find someone who will always chase me, but I would rather find someone who I never feel like I need to run from. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/05/15/wont-you-please-forgive-me"&gt;MonsterBallads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in church, even though they sing of other things, their prayers still include ships, all those at sea; pilots, lobster-crews, fisherman who have been yanked overboard on a line of creels, whole families lost in sudden squalls only a mile from land.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>QFT Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But in the end, just like any Full House episode, I learned a valuable lesson (Complete with poignant orchestral music) in friendship, humility and the problems that come with lying your ass off.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://whoregagger.codexed.com/2011/05/11/the-car-pt-1"&gt;WhoreGagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most other people felt something I didn't. And I find that a bit unsettling.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/05/11/emotional-processing-fail"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&#8217;ve finished growing up now, more or less. Now it&#8217;s time to be grown up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://mewithmyumbrella.codexed.com/2011/05/10/between-studenthood-and-real-lifehood"&gt;MeWithMyUmbrella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, I'm happy for you. The bit that burns is the fact that I cannot tell you this, because you will not deign to hear.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://withgreatzeal.codexed.com/2011/05/04/oh-shit"&gt;WithGreatZeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that red light flashing above your head was a good warning signal; it's just too bad I'm colorblind.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;A href="http://onesentencestories.codexed.com/2011/04/25/april-24th-2011"&gt;OneSentenceStories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am amazed that as a race of beings that all start out at the same place, and finish at the same place, we are so diversely unique. So many paths of pain and joy, so many faces of belief used to get to the end. yet no matter the road, emotions, or moral choices we still all end in the end.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bellwether.codexed.com/2011/05/08/untitled"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so simple of a thing to write about, heartbreak. Straightforward, really. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://k-kosa.codexed.com/2011/05/04/this-will-probably-not-make-much-sense-but-at-least-its"&gt;K-Kosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a place we have taken for granted; learn that it cannot be altered, only worked with and endured, the way river fish endure their wintry sleeves of ice. What matters, they say, is learning to live as a guest in this remarkable house that we&#8217;ve all inherited.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pine.codexed.com/2011/05/09/3-swimmer"&gt;Pine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I am going to learn how to stand in front of an orchestra, wave my wand, and create magic.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://moo.codexed.com/2011/05/10/magic"&gt;Moo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did my dreams of saving the world, saving the planet, creating public art and building communities fall?&lt;br/&gt;
Did I leave it on the plane, did I drop it in the ocean? Cause all I see in the mirror is wasteful disappointment with long brown hair.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://abstract.codexed.com/2011/05/05/two-years-in-the-making-why-am-i-here"&gt;Abstract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I suppose that it&#8217;s enough to be able to appreciate a spirituality without needing to ascribe to it, I do sometimes wish that I were wired to believe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://etymology.codexed.com/2011/05/08/shrine-maiden"&gt;Etymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also consider the possibility that, if not already, then one day, he will play songs - maybe even those songs - for someone else. Or that one day he wont play anything at all&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/05/07/white-flag"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the youngness stems from the fact that I was about to move and start all over again. And maybe that's exactly why I feel so old now.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/05/07/dreams-come-singing"&gt;MonsterBallads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the various yous in my past:&lt;br/&gt;
I miss us.&lt;br/&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess I'm much more of an emotional person than I'd like to admit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://nagareterutaki.codexed.com/2011/04/25/untitled"&gt;NagareteruTaki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is nothing left for you here. not even a song.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://raincoated.codexed.com/2011/04/23/sorry-that-i-could-never-love-you-backi-could-never"&gt;Raincoated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were never so alike and so different and that's what made us who we were.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/04/25/the-underworld"&gt;Monsterballads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine most folks tend to find their niche and sub culture and stick to it with super bonding glue and hang there until they hit around thirty and join the generalised uncool masses that are proper adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://rhizic.codexed.com/2011/04/26/lifestyles"&gt;Rhizic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, we're more or less where we need to be.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/04/26/more-or-less"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've closed myself to the point where I can't express what I want to say when I want to.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://love.codexed.com/2011/04/27/untitled"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the actual touch of her lingered, inside his heart.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/04/27/lingering-memories"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a reminder that he&#8217;s living his life as he always expected&#8212;no more, no less, no hidden joys or sudden change&#8212;just a certainty that the silent shape he fears will one day arrive to claim him.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pine.codexed.com/2011/04/27/untitled"&gt;Pine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I liked it better when I had fewer friends&#8212;when no one knew who I was or how I managed my life&#8212;when no one could see beyond the strict fence I cobbled together around myself: tiny stones each chosen not just for their shape and color, but their consistency, their strength.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://poetics.codexed.com/2011/04/24/fissures"&gt;Poetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, life likes to take me for a little adventure. Sometimes, the ride&#8217;s wonderful: I return exhilarated and ready for my next joyous fix. Mostly, it&#8217;s a nerve-wracking trip of extreme highs and lows, and I cannot wait to get off.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/04/26/extraordinary"&gt;FolkJokeOpus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that red light flashing above your head was a good warning signal; it's just too bad I'm colorblind.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love her.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://grey.codexed.com/2011/04/20/untitled"&gt;Grey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We apologize for the delay in this week's QFT update. As a reminder, please submit! This project is fueled by your contributions, and without them, we can't update. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a weird memory, which makes memorizing random facts ridiculously easy as breathing but remembering to take out the trash impossible.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/04/12/the-invasion"&gt;Monsterballads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the beast&lt;br/&gt;
whose burden you deny, the&lt;br/&gt;
fence you lean your back against&lt;br/&gt;
when you've forgotten you can&lt;br/&gt;
fly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://poetymology.codexed.com/2011/04/13/gradient"&gt;Poetymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i thought you would be sorry. do you even remember me? you were always the storm.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://raincoated.codexed.com/2011/04/13/lament"&gt;Raincoated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her life, she waits.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://starsarefalling.codexed.com/2011/04/11/untitled"&gt;StarsAreFalling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel judged at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2011/04/10/difficult-days-ahead-l"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on painting crazy shit in my room, hanging all the trinkets and toys I've come across in my world travels and making it a base of operations for further scheming of world domination.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/04/12/pressure-cooker"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I've managed to make it work, this mishmash of handmedown furniture and two very different styles- his bold and utilitarian, mine delicate and traditional. But here we all are, coexisting with relative tranquility and grace.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fierceradiant.codexed.com/2011/04/13/morning-and-silk"&gt;FierceRadiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how I wrote that we're all in a great big play? I think it's true. The scripts must be limited, because....somewhere, somebody is feeling how I'm feeling, thinking what I'm thinking, saying what I'm saying. Somebody even looks how I look.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://plainwrap.codexed.com/2011/04/13/10"&gt;Plainwrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels great to be outside in all weathers: the rain in my eyes and seeping under my collar, the sun bringing out a constellation of freckles, the fluorescence of the fields popping under a flat grey sky.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/04/11/t-minus"&gt;FolkJokeOpus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't judge, lest ye be judged as the good book says (That would be Horton Hears A Who, if you're wondering).&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;a href="http://El_Warmachine.codexed.com/2011/03/30/penny-heavy-thoughts"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There once was a poet called Poe&lt;br/&gt;
who, expecting his day full of woe,&lt;br/&gt;
would waltz 'round unshaven&lt;br/&gt;
writing words for the raven,&lt;br/&gt;
but never once thought of the crow.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://poetymology.codexed.com/2011/04/05/chamber-turning"&gt;Poetymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not kids that I love (maybe a little&#8230;) but their lack of a filter. They feel no shame. I wish it were more socially acceptable to shout random compliments at people. Not just to be on the receiving end, but there have definitely been times when I&#8217;ve wanted to say something nice to a stranger and I didn&#8217;t because I felt it would be weird. Why is complimenting someone weird when you&#8217;re an adult but okay when you&#8217;re a child?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://disturbedanonymous.codexed.com/2011/04/06/trying-to-turn-this-bottle-into-gold"&gt;DisturbedAnonymous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My b-hole burned neon red.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://whoregagger.codexed.com/2011/04/04/the-bad-wiping-incident"&gt;WhoreGagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of here, existing, being a technical writing machine and wishing, deeply, for something more or something else.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ethereal.codexed.com/2011/04/04/off-kilter"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True self sufficiency is admirable, but when we struggle alone, we deny a beautiful aspect of human nature. Exercising compassion towards others is wonderful, but if this is the only way we relate to compassion, then we're missing out. Giving without receiving is like admiring a sculpture from only one side. It's still beautiful, but the experience is incomplete. To fully appreciate the sculpture, it's better to see it from the other side as well.&lt;br/&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bet you make more of a positive difference in people's lives than you realise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/03/29/good-people"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is well while its just inside my head.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/03/29/wishing"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is stupid. Don't let anybody tell you differently. You know marriages? They're stupid too. Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Husbands? Wives? Common Law Marriages? All stupid. The only thing that is more stupider than love, are people who say they are in love. Because love doesn't exist. It's as make believe as my 14 inch cock (Mine is only 13). Love is a fairy tale word in a fairy tale world and everybody but you gets to ride the merry-go-round. Love is where losers go to die loser-y deaths because L-O-V-E is actually a shitty little city in northern Ireland where the local government rips your heart out, places it on a stake and laughs sardonically as you slowly die, cold and alone and heartless with no-one by your side.&lt;br/&gt;

Not so hard a title to have when you are always right.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bellwether.codexed.com/2011/03/22/rant-pant-cant-slant"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look away. It's just a fiction&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://lethologica.codexed.com/2011/03/20/family-reunion"&gt;Lethologica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about how beautiful people can be. The capacity of how much love, generosity, and overall goodwill can be poured between people.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/03/22/everybodys-free"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m but one girl with no plans of ever having a family; I don&#8217;t need much space to live happily on my own. A sustainable space in which I can read, write, and sew: I could be happy in a home like that.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://etymology.codexed.com/2011/02/18/limbo"&gt;Etymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's like with every heartbeat under my ribcage, there's a whisper in my ear urging me to go. And one day the rest of me is going to follow suit and just leave. Then, maybe, that little voice will sigh, "finally."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/03/22/amelia"&gt;MonsterBallads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by choosing a direction, not feel like my direction is choosing me. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fierceradiant.codexed.com/2011/03/23/therapy"&gt;FierceRadiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much that I am feeling that defies words--so much that's just contained in her eyes that I cannot distill, so much in her touch that is untranslatable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2011/03/22/sandy-toes"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And somehow, after growing up, when stuff like this shouldn't matter, that bundle of nerves that was shocked into existence during those days of helplessness and tears over the pillow still remained, reminding me of an invisible wall I'd always wanted to break through.&lt;br/&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are ways to hold on to such hopes (even with barely a roof to call my own), whatever they really are.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/03/10/currently"&gt;Folkjokeopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I can't stand my own company, I stop meditating.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/03/10/rally"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if this was what it was like to be a Caesar in Rome. Or a reigning gladiator. Or a star NFL player after winning a hometown game. A new president elect gripping a newspaper with his/her name printed victoriously all over it. Charlie Sheen in his usual brothel.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/03/09/a-heros-welcome"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to memorize the pattern so that I might draw the symbol when I return to Malkuth, but as soon as this thought enters my head, the image is snuffed out like a candle; the swirling cloud-like things around me turn to black, begin to fade; I plummet downwards, only to wake up in my bedroom, enthused but not very well rested.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://octo7.codexed.com/2011/03/11/untitled"&gt;Octo7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am happy with that, and I am happy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2011/03/11/forward-progress"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people mean so much to me because I mean so much to them, and it amazes me that all friendships aren&#8217;t this way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/03/16/last-night"&gt;Monsterballads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like smiles, so I take them where I get them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://caligula.codexed.com/2011/03/14/when-i-think-about-you"&gt;Caligula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I've been waiting my whole life for someone to love me like this.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't need to be afraid; I don't need to be ashamed; here is a place I can be true--here is a person with whom I can shed my inhibitions and my apprehensions, and I can simply be.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2011/03/06/their-loss-your-gain"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its ok to look back every now and again, just so long as I dont end up going in the wrong direction once more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/03/09/the-difference-a-day-makes"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://ethereal.codexed.com/2011/03/09/not-so-much"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don&#8217;t want your advice, or anyone else&#8217;s.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://octo7.codexed.com/2011/03/07/advice-and-responsbility"&gt;Octo7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The tendency to make things seem even worse than they are really sickens me. Isn't reality tragic enough?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/02/23/proud-to-be"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to feel the contours of turf and stone against my skin once more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/02/26/number-one"&gt;Folkjokeopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's it going to take for me to be happy? What? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You. Just you. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://heartbeat.codexed.com/2011/03/02/could-it-be-that-time-has-taken-its-toll"&gt;Heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn to trust in the people who love you in a way you could never imagine before.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://selkie.codexed.com/2011/02/28/the-new-normal"&gt;Selkie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When will things be okay? I'm not asking for great, or even good. In this, I am merely shooting for mediocrity. I just want to be okay.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://beej.codexed.com/2011/03/01/okay"&gt;Beej&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's strange letting your guard down. It's like being naked when I release the grips on my pistols. But that's what falling in love makes you do, right?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As i stared in horror, like a deer caught in the headlights, at the driver, i heard the doors open. He motioned for me to come around.&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Uh, Miss - did you want to catch this bus?&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Yes. Yes i did, thank you.&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Most people just wave. I&#8217;d recommend that next time.&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Yes. I changed my mind at the last minute. Like, when you nearly ran me down.&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would die in that moment, in the sheer terror of not knowing how she would reply, and in the brief silence that lapsed between us, I thought I could feel the earth rending beneath my feet.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve got words. They&#8217;re humming and buzzing just under the surface of my skin. They&#8217;re threatening to burst out of my chest like some alien parasite or else burn up the back of my throat and spill out across everything like that time I vomited off the side of my lofted bed.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Rock 'n Roll</title>
    <content type="html">Dear Dust,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Our Official Bonding Moment was in junior year of high school.  I don't know why I feel the need to write that in capital letters.  It just seems proper.  Important, like you always were to me.  Anyway, this moment occurred long after you had criticized my sister for her homophobic tendencies, but well before I moved half a continent away.  I'd say this was right about the time I was realizing how difficult it would be to say goodbye to you, when that came.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For the most part, I couldn't pick those last years of school out of a line-up, and that's probably for the best, as they never did me any harm.  In contrast, the moments I spent with you stand out, and if I had to finger a specific one as the culprit of my attachment to you, I'd point directly to what I'm about to describe. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It was one of those casually hot Texas days.  It was late in the evening, and we were stuck to my dad's old leather couch.  Nothing particularly bad had happened, nor was there a momentous occasion that I can say we were celebrating.  We were simply existing as two friends do:  easily and semi-eloquently.  We'd been through worse days, to be sure, but on this night, I remember being especially exhausted, prone to your soft voice, slurred vowels, hushed tone.  I'd probably complained for a good half hour about the heat, my family, and how ready I was to be finished with school.  I'm sure I was tiresome.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But you listened like you cared--or at least understood--and then I stretched, stood up, and walked toward our old television.  I swung open the barnwood doors of our entertainment center a bit wider, and put in a CD.  It was &lt;i&gt;Fallen&lt;/i&gt; by Evanescence.  Positioned closely together, we listened to the lilting strands of &lt;i&gt;My Immortal&lt;/i&gt;, and I remember thinking, "If the world could slow to a crawl, the wind bunker down to a summered stillness, the cars quiet in the streets, and conversation settle to a lull, I would want it to surround a moment like this."  Maybe not so verbosely, but you get the picture.  We connected over a band that I'm not sure exists any longer.  This is fine with me, as we don't either, at least not in as sure a manner as we used to.  I guess we can't, so long as the miles are involved.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But here's the thing:  I still cherish you.  I'm not sure how many times I referred to you as my best friend.  I'm not even sure if you reciprocated the need or passion that I felt in your presence.  In all honesty, that matters even less now than it did then.  We were what (and who) we wanted to be, and it suited us well enough that we never questioned it.  I'm not one for praying these days, but I still thank God you came around when you did, all sorts of sensitive and wearing your lettermen's jacket, and I still remember the color of your truck and how many times it took us to actually get our goodbyes right--and more than that, finalized.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I guess that's the way things go.  People always say that when you graduate, it changes you forever.  That it's the turning point of your life.  I fought this with every bit of obstinateness in me, but it seems to have happened anyway.  There's got to come a point when you relinquish control to the passage of time.  Regardless, I still think of you with an overwhelming amount of fondness--perhaps in an effort to counteract all of the anger I feel at the world for separating us.  Truncated phone calls and sparse text messages just don't do your conversational skills justice.    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I'm writing this to remind you (and myself) of how close we really were.  How much I loved you and how much I still do.     &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Another 7 months</title>
    <content type="html">My dear You, &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I wrote you a letter about a year ago explaining the impact of what was then our latest encounter.  I knew, even as the words left my head, that the letter would be unsent forever.  We have known each other for 12 years now.  I've seen you once since then, another 7 months ago and thought of you since then almost every day.  Every day, except for the ones where I made myself not think of you.  Your beauty is beyond reason, your depravity and mental condition are living reminders to me that the best things on earth are flawed and bruised and hurt but so very beautiful all the same.  A year ago when I wrote you that letter I hated your fiance, now he's gone.  Today I hate the tattoo artist guy you're dating who makes more money than I will likely ever make and takes you on trips to New York, Mexico, maybe Ohio too.  When I think of the chances I've been given I feel only a sort of numb and constant regret.  7 months ago you sat on a bench with me at the waterfront.  We were half-drunk and I was half in love.  Today I know in the deepest part of my self that we will never be and that realistically I am somewhat obsessed with a version of you that does not likely exist.  Regardless of that, I eagerly await your next contact. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Love Always, &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am waiting for this lightness, for whatever mental wall that holds me back to crumble. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://canter.codexed.com/2011/02/13/on-running"&gt;Canter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am shedding my insecurities. It is not easy to wear all that I am on the outside. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morsmordre.codexed.com/2011/02/16/sometimes-a-jimi-thing-slides-my-way"&gt;Morsmordre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still need to figure out how to feel anything again. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://caligula.codexed.com/2011/02/16/assembly-required"&gt;Caligula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be spent on garden paths and talked about in hushed tones.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://poetics.codexed.com/2011/02/12/nothings-are-sweet"&gt;Poetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it feels like the same thing over and over again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://snow.codexed.com/2011/02/16/curse"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know your journal entries scare people when they call to see if you&#8217;re alright. Oops.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ethereal.codexed.com/2011/02/16/existence"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nervous knots in my stomach, the kind that convince me I&#8217;m about to embark on a thrilling adventure. I can&#8217;t keep from smiling.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2011/02/16/a-bad-day-the-lure-of-the-land"&gt;FolkJokeOpus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast is so stark: so full and so alive one moment, and so destitute and empty one tick forward later.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am as much the same girl as I was at sixteen as I will be at twenty-six, which is both comforting and distressing in equal measure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://etymology.codexed.com/2011/02/14/keep-dancing"&gt;Etymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago I longed for the same hackneyed cliches, the soft-fingered touches, the suffocating heat of bodies clasped, for someone to discover the "true" self.  The word is overrated.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t give in. I fight. I fight and fight and fight, and I keep taking notes, and I write through my sleep, even though I can&#8217;t read it.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m sick of being stuck in traffic jams, I&#8217;m sick of feeling like I&#8217;ll never belong, I&#8217;m sick of being so afraid of other people, and I&#8217;ll be damned if I don&#8217;t spend the next four years embracing the great sea of a million people who can, and will, understand the shit that I want.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Your Heart Isn't Open Anymore</title>
    <content type="html">My darling Lucrezia,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	Scarcely had my eyes settled upon you at the hour of our first meeting before my heart had been sent upon a race--a race in which I, quite tragically, would always end up placing second. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	You spoke of your interests with a gentility far beyond the crude vocabularies of our peers--your eyes seemed to shimmer with the possibilities of the future ahead of you. And your laughter, like the ringing of bells, came in great crashing peals that surrounded and drowned me in your mirth. We spoke in libraries and hallways, never for very long, but always at the precisely perfect length: masterfully measured strings of syllables, as though Lachesis herself had deigned to draw us together.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	And here we parted ways for the first time: another man came gallivanting into your life, clumsily took you by the hand, and professed the power of love. Starry-eyed, you went tumbling after him, and so I tipped my hat to you, happy to step back.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	We know how that ended, though: we know the hell and the horror of the speeches that cleaved you from each other. For a time, we drifted, silently separated.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	When we came together again, we were still kept apart: once more you had set yourself to spilling your secrets and surrendering your sex. I watched from a distance, my heart aching: there was still a lilt in your voice that turned my eyes heavenward, a rhythm in your step that I wished to match, and a power in your embrace that I wanted to taste. Yet you were happy, and that was good enough for me: after all, in the end, I am more desirous of your pleasure than mine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	But something happened. Mistakes were made, and misunderstandings were multiplied. You fell apart in the most terrible of ways. By coincidence, my own endeavors failed simultaneously, and so we were left together: brokenhearted, teary-eyed, desperate to make some sense of things. By sheer power of will I worked to support you when I could barely support myself. Oh, Lucrezia, I remember the nights you cried: each of them I recall so vividly because the tears in my own eyes so often made the way forward difficult to see, and we could only assume that we lived in an everlasting purgatorial pain.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	In the darkness, we could see the first flickers of a flame between us.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	It took time--so much time, because there was such confusion and pain in our hearts. It seems, now, that these things still exist in your heart, and you have let them taint your outlook on life--and your outlook on me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	We took that first step together: it was by no means an arbitrary decision on my part or yours. I feel that the truth is that we both knew before we began the boundaries we would need to run beside; we both knew what we wanted and how we could obtain that, but somewhere along the way, you seem to have forgotten now.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	Now, Lucrezia, you seem keen to cut me out, as though I were a vile cancer bent on extracting the life from your body. So you have tipped your poison into my drink, and yours was a movement so sweet, so silent, that I drank the substance down without a second thought. I have invested much trust in you, after all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	I have choked and retched and demanded explanations for this: did you think I was going to take advantage of you? Did you fancy me to be like all those others, who were out to rend your porcelain heart to pretty bits? You would not even give the chance to explain myself before you took action and dispensed your swift and vicious judgmental justice.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	So I will pass on, Lucrezia--I will pass from these sufferings and seek out a peace far greater than your arms ever could have offered me. I wished to give you so much, but you allowed me so little.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	One day, you will know the bite of the poison, too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
	As always, I remain, ineffectually yours,&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>QFT Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crying is healthy. It&#8217;s a reminder that you do know how to feel.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ethereal.codexed.com/2011/02/03/thursday-13-things-i-need-to-remember"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insecurities are my worst enemy. I have to love myself, I have to learn how to be good enough for myself.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morsmordre.codexed.com/2011/01/26/one-day-hour-minute-second-breath-at-a-time"&gt;MorseMordre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will move on and because my reserve of strength runs deep, I'll do it in style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/01/31/removed"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll end it here, not because I want to, but because that's the position you've placed me in, and I can't even hope for a stalemate anymore.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2011/02/01/check"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not the person I was before I enlisted.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://murinoto.codexed.com/2011/01/30/clingwrap"&gt;Murinoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need you to understand it is for a reason because I am [not sure where this sentence was going]. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://caligula.codexed.com/2011/01/30/a-couple-concerns-that-spiraled-out-of-control"&gt;Caligula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever said sex isn't complicated is full of shit. In fact, when you think about it, you start learning a new language when you get yourself involved in it. A dirty language.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/02/02/lady-and-the-tramp-iii"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don't mind being underestimated, because then I can just prove everyone wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://equinox.codexed.com/2011/01/31/the-sword-in-the-stone"&gt;Equinox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about a godawful ex-girlfriend is, you just look fan-fucking-tastic in comparison. No, really. I could take a dull spork, stab it in A&#8217;s eye and he could wear a pirate patch for the rest of his life, and I would still come out looking like the better girlfriend. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://gargoylegas.codexed.com/2011/01/28/wheres-the-breaks-on-this-thing"&gt;GargoyleGas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when it seems like you've lost almost every battle just remember it only takes one win to put a smile back on your face.&lt;br/&gt;

Will it burn bright and guide us home?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2011/01/25/displaced-twilight"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to stop letting other people make me feel bad about myself.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://equinox.codexed.com/2011/01/24/stiff-drinks-and-cigarettes"&gt;Equinox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no crime in wanting to love and be loved.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://caligula.codexed.com/2011/01/26/its-love"&gt;Caligula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;re honest with yourself, it&#8217;s for you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://redemption.codexed.com/2011/01/26/whatever-you-wish-for-you-keep"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insecurities are my worst enemy.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write, I am the sharp point of the pen. All of my energy is focused there, into the blue line of varying lengths, into the ink that makes up that line. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fictional.codexed.com/2011/01/25/parenthetical-problem"&gt;Fictional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are questions I cannot answer&lt;br/&gt;
and words I cannot say.&lt;br/&gt;
There are ideas I cannot fathom&lt;br/&gt;
and roles I cannot play.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus have I become a phantom, the essence of cliche.&lt;br/&gt;
