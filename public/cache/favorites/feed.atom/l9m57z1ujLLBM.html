    <title>Mistletoe</title>
    <content type="html">After dinner, we collapsed sleepily on the floor and played boardgames, our sore knees and elbows propped up by pillows. My border-country friend asserted that Monopoly is more fun if you can steal from the bank whilst the other player isn&#8217;t looking. (I still won.) Later, we ate my homemade Christmas pudding, and drank 25-year-old Laphroaig neat from the bottle. Thorn, his gentle black Labrador, eagerly cleaned our plates of leftovers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/folkjokeopus/5292262309/" title="Using a friend's camera - by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5129/5292262309_1698867d7b.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On the 24th we&#8217;d taken a slow walk by the forest and rivers which form at the rear of his house. Excluding garden and orchard, he owns about 15 acres of woodland in total (the rest is publicly accessible). He lent me use of one of his (entry-level) cameras in the absence of my own, but I was too shutter shy and only took ten photos, almost all of which I deleted after seeing his efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/folkjokeopus/5292261775/" title="Taken by my friend - by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5162/5292261775_696ddf247b.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is mistletoe growing parasitically on one of his older apple trees. After dessert, he went outside to pick some and came back half an hour later, emblazoned from head to waist in their slender stems and translucent white berries, like a festive version of the Green Man. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Apart from laughing, the other activity his endearing daftness so easily mustered from me was, of course, a traditional mistletoe kiss. We blushed furiously at each other for the rest of the night. </content>

    <title>Puddings and companions</title>
    <content type="html">It&#8217;s Christmas Eve tomorrow, and this is usually when I wonder if I&#8217;ll get sick, so the 25th can be spent in bed, distanced from the din of wasteful festivities and superfluous gift-giving. I&#8217;ve succeeded by miraculously acquiring &#8216;flu three out of the last four years.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I think about my estranged father a lot around this time. Despite his atrocities, I still try to wish him well. A small part of me is unsure if he is even lucid enough any more to distinguish one day from another, but perhaps his empty mind is for the best.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since the 14th, I&#8217;ve been with my border-country friend. It was a last-minute decision to travel up to him, but a good one, nonetheless.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm138/dwillandbiscuit/puddingsmall.jpg"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I made a traditional Christmas pudding the day before I left. It was supposed to journey with me to my family in London, but that fell through. Now it will help sustain my too-thin companion as he &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt; graciously allows me to crash with him over this holiday season. It frustrates me that he is happy to accept a pudding in lieu of actual payment. (Last time was a &lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2010/10/25/home-away-from-home"&gt;cinnamon-apple cake&lt;/a&gt;, amongst other things.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm138/dwillandbiscuit/pudding2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If I had more time (and had uploaded all the images before leaving Devon), there would have been a recipe to accompany this. (It&#8217;s delicious.) Never mind.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The weather in this part of the country can be brutal and unforgiving at the best of times. Those who live on the most isolated northerly extremities or archipelagos have almost no means of accessing basic amenities when the snow is this treacherous. My friend has been unable to work (outside) for the last two weeks, but at least he&#8217;s only an hour&#8217;s (cautious) drive from town. It&#8217;s more than most.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Except for a few times on skis, I&#8217;ve never experienced this amount of snow before; sadly, I don&#8217;t have my camera here to record it. In some places, the drifts reach our knees, so we pull on waist-high waders when (nervously) out walking. Even so, I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of icicles I&#8217;ve crunched, and the lacy snowflakes that have melted on my tongue.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The last couple of days have been the most hurtful in just as many years. Despite feeling (cognitively) worse than when I left last week, I&#8217;m trying my hardest to remain upbeat, at least for the benefit of others. After all, I could have been spending Christmas alone (which I wouldn&#8217;t have minded), but snuggled in my friend&#8217;s log-fired farmhouse amidst the whitewashed hills is, I suppose, reason enough to feel thankful (and to fend off the &#8216;flu&#8230; just this once).</content>

    <title>The night fishers</title>
    <content type="html">I heard their voices before I noticed their dark shapes. The brown trout will be slow and dumb in this cold spell, they said. For trespassers on private land, they were surprisingly vocal.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
They were guided by the light of their mobile phones, and their long rods were held aloft, like masts, as they slowly picked their way towards the lake. They set down their bait boxes and cast two lines. I watched them from the barn.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I gave them ten minutes, I think. Enough to get comfortable in the reeds, and familiar with the tension of their reels.&#160;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When the halogen lamp snapped on, it illuminated the whole lake like the sky had lit a flare, and the old boughs of the oak tree burned shadows on the lawn. The night fishers panicked and bolted across the tall grass, through a hole in the hedgerow. In the sudden light they were nothing more than two slight teenagers in black cagoules.&#160;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I couldn&#8217;t sleep after that, and went indoors, somewhat shaken. It&#8217;s getting too cold in the barn for a two-season sleeping bag, anyway.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This morning began bright and burnished. I&#8217;m writing this on a bus, which has just crossed the border out of Devon. It&#8217;s grey towards the east.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/folkjokeopus/5259903683/" title="Untitled by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5244/5259903683_6790b3d5cc.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In their haste, the night fishers left their gear behind. I won&#8217;t be around for a while to see whether they return to collect it.</content>

    <title>The weakest link</title>
    <content type="html">I&#8217;ve reinstated (some of) the remainder of my 2010 archives, and even less of those from 2009.  It perturbs me just how appalling my writing was prior to my return here, and I wonder how long these words will remain visible before I balk and remove them again. (Incidentally, I recently unearthed a surfeit of journal entries from 2003 to 2004, and they&#8217;re so mortifyingly overdramatic, I couldn&#8217;t bear to read them all through.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The conservation qualification has been shifted forward again, to the first week in January. This is favourable because it leaves me with less idle time to squander, but I cannot shake the (as yet unfounded) trepidation that I will neither be suitable, nor capable, of this type of physical labour. My body is lithe and wiry, but I still don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to carry heavy stones, or how difficult the various tools will be to operate. I&#8217;m used to achieving, and have never really been in a position where it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;ll be (literally) the weakest link.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Invasive (plant) species control is a skill I have an elementary understanding of, but for the most part, I&#8217;ll be plunged into the deep end. My biggest concern is being unable to master the building of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_stone#Dry_stone_walls"&gt;dry-stone walls&lt;/a&gt;, a tradition I&#8217;ve been enamoured with for several years (thanks to the work of Andy Goldsworthy), and more so since moving to the countryside and having the privilege of seeing such accomplished masonry in situ. And, up until last week, I didn&#8217;t even own the right clothing (steel-toe boots, drill trousers, padded shirts), none of which do women&#8217;s sizes. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, and I&#8217;m not irked by beginning at the bottom. I just hope I don&#8217;t remain there.</content>

    <title>I'm incredibly fortunate</title>
    <content type="html">It was an expensive (last minute) train ride to London to see friends whose faces had grown unfamiliar, and to attend with them a concert I&#8217;d forgotten about until I found myself humming &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/i7mEB2wnDLQ"&gt;Animal Nitrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; whilst raking leaves and stones from public bridleways. After my shift, I jogged back through the forest, and had just enough time to pack a rucksack and make the impromptu journey east to my old home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We drank gin in the mosh pit, and struggled to breathe beneath the hot cloud of taller followers. I still knew all the words, still remembered to sneer and swagger to the choruses. Most of the gigs I attend take place in a village hall, or in someone&#8217;s cosy front room. This arena seemed like an entirely different planet, populated by whirring beams, and shape-throwing, and lighter flames floating dreamily above my head.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;m no stranger to sleeping rough. When my depression was at its worst, I used to travel several hundred miles north to Yorkshire and take cover for a night (or more) against the leeward side of a hedgerow or dry-stone wall. The cold (and the absolute feeling of isolation) lulled me to sleep after long days of wandering the moors. Admittedly, this was several years ago, and now I&#8217;d at least have the good sense to bring a tent should this desire rear again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Having spent the last three weeks &lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2010/11/18/sunset-over-the-lake"&gt;bedded in the barn&lt;/a&gt;, curling up on a station bench in early December was a fairly simple decision to make. I could have turned up at my mother&#8217;s house in the suburbs, but I knew she had several guests over. (Of course) she wouldn&#8217;t have sent me away, but I didn&#8217;t want the company. The claustrophobia of the concert was enough, as was the clutter of my mind.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If I&#8217;d shared the station with another sleeper, a homeless person, perhaps, then I might have felt more guilty over my selective recklessness, and booked accommodation or crashed with one of my friends, instead. A few winters ago I volunteered at a soup-run, and it was by far one of the most harrowing (and humbling) three months of my life. My living arrangements in Devon may currently be uncertain, but there&#8217;s no doubting that I&#8217;m incredibly fortunate in (almost) every aspect of my existence.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The next morning, I walked diagonally from one corner of London to the other. It took me the whole day, including passing through the centre of the shopping district (I didn&#8217;t buy any presents), before finally catching the train home. Through the plate windows, it happened to be the first clear night since November. There were three shooting stars within the space of a couple of minutes. It felt good to wish for people other than myself.</content>

    <title>Wanderlust</title>
    <content type="html">There was an unexpected sleet storm yesterday. Nonetheless, I turned up at the forest for five-thirty a.m., only to find no-one else had arrived. I waited alone for an hour (under a fir tree) before calling it quits. Later, switching on my phone, there was a message to say the day had been cancelled because it was too risky for everyone to drive in. (My boots are still wet this morning.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5230049938/" title="Untitled by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5248/5230049938_a55366d27d.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;m itching to get away again. The conservation work is enjoyable, and I&#8217;m fairly good at it (much to the chagrin of some of my male co-volunteers), but all it&#8217;s really doing is temporarily numbing the concerns I have. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At present, I don&#8217;t know what will make me feel better, or what will fix things. I&#8217;m not depressed (thankfully), but these invasive worries could very well escalate into that. If I surrender to wanderlust, I&#8217;d still be running away from my problems on legs that will only carry me so far. I&#8217;d still eventually thaw out of that numbness.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5230062176/" title="Untitled by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5230062176_e695a99df6.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Besides, I don&#8217;t even know where I&#8217;d head to, or when I&#8217;d ever return. And that unnerves me.</content>

    <title>Leaves, not lectures</title>
    <content type="html">I&#8217;m the only female on the conservation team. We work from five a.m. to eleven a.m. (I only attend three times a week), with a thirty minute break.&#160;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If the task requires a group effort, such as &#8216;steeping&#8217; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_laying"&gt;hedge laying&lt;/a&gt;), we vote on when to take the break; if we&#8217;re working individually (planting a row of saplings, say), it&#8217;s up to us. The general consensus is that the later the break is taken, the less time there is left to labour before one can go home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On Saturday&#8217;s break, I was collared by one of the older volunteers (he is thirty-seven). We talked about what we&#8217;d done prior to joining this team. He told me he left school at sixteen and has worked on the land ever since. He said he was volunteering here because he wanted to move from farming to forestry. Finally, he asked, bluntly, why someone like me wanted to work in such a physical, male-dominated environment (&lt;i&gt;with your posh accent and your degrees&lt;/i&gt;, were his precise words).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After explaining my reasons, I (cynically) assumed he would reproach me for shunning the opportunities offered to me in academia, but instead he told me I was making a courageous decision; he thought it admirable that I wanted to make a quiet(er) impact on the world, one that was &lt;i&gt;expressed in leaves, not lectures&lt;/i&gt;. It was his last day volunteering before he travelled back home (towards the north). I never learned his name, but his statement stuck with me. He reminded me of my border-country friend, whom I&#8217;m missing terribly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5222279146/" title="Untitled by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5222279146_0a3766745d.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Where I work is an hour away from my home. The whole walk for me, from doorstep to woodland, takes place amongst fields and trees. I set off some mornings with a torch. There are no roads, and I see no-one in that time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5221678867/" title="Untitled by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5221678867_542009e120.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The conservation qualification I mentioned &lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2010/11/12/changes"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; has been postponed until next year (February, they speculate) due to several drop-outs. I&#8217;m unsure as to how I&#8217;ll fill my days before then. I don&#8217;t intend to volunteer here past December, but a lot of that has to do with an uncertainly about my living arrangements.</content>

    <title>Sunset over the lake</title>
    <content type="html">The house is flanked on one side by two barns. The first was burnt down in an arson attack a couple of years ago, destroying all the previous owners&#8217; (unwanted) possessions. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still difficult to walk past the blackened shell and not think of the history that perished with it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The second barn is partly intact. Some of the windows don&#8217;t have glass (the frames don&#8217;t have doors), and some of the upper storey has holes in the wooden floor. This is where I have been ensconced for the last five days.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though not particularly practical when the weather is this cold and wet, I&#8217;ve found a small nook that was rebuilt in brick, and it&#8217;s surprisingly cosy. This is where the cats sometimes hide,  though I&#8217;ve yet to have company. One of the elderly fir trees has worked a bough through a gap in the roof, and it tickles the back of my neck while I use the laptop.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Five minutes away, there is a perfectly warm and comfortable bed. But I don&#8217;t fall asleep to a sunset over the lake, only to ever-compounding worries. I know which of these I prefer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
On an unrelated note, I have to be in London for the next few days to give a poetry reading. It&#8217;s been planned for a while, and it would be churlish of me to pull out at the last minute. The poem is called &#8216;Confluence,&#8217; and I&#8217;ve temporarily &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/confluence"&gt;posted it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, if you&#8217;re interested.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(And thank you for your kind comments on the &lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2010/11/16/honoured"&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt;. It&#8217;s nice to have some good news to share, for once.)</content>

    <title>Honoured</title>
    <content type="html">Since the summer, my days have often been overwhelmingly up and down. This constant undulation first threatened to drown my studies, then (to a greater extent) my sense of self-worth. I feel incredibly fortunate and thankful to have been dispensed a wealth of distractions (travelling, conservation work, writing, friends). They all arrived to save me at just the right time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My &lt;a href="http://folkjokeopus.codexed.com/2010/09/13/where-ive-been"&gt;Master&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; result arrived at just the right time, too. First-Class Honours.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It&#8217;s the (delightful) news I&#8217;ve been wringing my hands over since September, and I can finally admit to myself (with a tiny amount of conviction) that I&#8217;m a competent poet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Here&#8217;s a celebratory Hasselblad photo. I&#8217;m almost as pleased with this as I am with my degree ^_^.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Changes</title>
    <content type="html">This part of England doesn&#8217;t change. London shapes and reshapes overnight, Devon remains static. The thatched roofs might moss over a little more, the bracken might encroach on the footpath, but except for the gentle intrusion of the four seasons, home looks like home, month on end. I find this familiarity comforting, especially since I&#8217;ve been so reluctant to return. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To counteract some of the difficulties I&#8217;m facing now I&#8217;m finally back, I&#8217;ve re-launched myself into volunteering. The lackadaisical approach they have to hours means I can come and go as I please. At six o&#8217;clock this morning, I helped fell an infested elm. Dutch Elm disease is one of the most prolific and destructive arboreal afflictions. It upset me to witness it, but for the sake of the surrounding woodland ecology, it was terribly necessary to do.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;ve also been accepted to work towards a skills-based qualification in conservation. There&#8217;ll be some written exams, which, even with my embarrassingly modest knowledge, I hope to breeze through, but mostly I&#8217;ll be learning how to &#8216;gap&#8217; (repair) and build dry-stone walls, work with soil and trees, etc. It will be physically demanding, but (save for my problematic knee) I&#8217;m lucky to be fit and active.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Somewhat concomitantly, a friendly local restaurant in my town has asked me to adorn their walls with moorland photographs. In return, I get all the profits made on any that sell. Once I buy a new backpack, I&#8217;ll be spending even more time outside, simply looking for the loveliest compositions. Just my camera and I. (This sort of companionship is all I&#8217;m really asking for at the moment.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
There are other things I want/need to write about, but when I reflect upon the last few weeks, I struggle to hold my composure. So they&#8217;ll have to wait.</content>

    <title>The Devil's Stone</title>
    <content type="html">I enjoy watching fireworks, but for the last couple of times, I&#8217;ve attended the turning of the Devil&#8217;s Stone. Supposedly, Satan dropped this stone whilst passing through the village;  thus the bellringers carry out this ancient ritual every November 5th, as it is (apparently) the only way to keep him from returning.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="434" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=61cfb338ac&amp;photo_id=5150242177"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=61cfb338ac&amp;photo_id=5150242177" height="300" width="434"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The rock itself is a glacial erratic - i.e., it is not part of the local geology, and another theory is that it may have been an altar-stone, brought over by a Druidic cult. Whatever the legend, it&#8217;s a delightfully quirky event, and as it&#8217;s only ever witnessed by fewer than a hundred people every year, also a great way to feel part of a community that is fiercely proud of its traditions. Thank you for watching ^_^.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Stormy goodbyes</title>
    <content type="html">My friend was caught in a terrible storm yesterday. The morning had started off pleasantly sunny, and he went out to work in a t-shirt and long shorts. By midday, the rain clouds had gathered; by two o&#8217;clock the trees were being tugged out of shape by the wind. His phone is never switched on, so perhaps I should have called a ranger, but instead I just sat numbly in the study, worrying and waiting for him. He understands the hills and rivers of his homeland better than anyone, and a part of me trusted in that knowledge to keep him safe. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just after eleven thirty that evening, he arrived home, unscathed. Despite being completely exhausted and soaked to the bone, his first (shaky) words to me were &#8216;D&#8217;you think this camera is okay?&#8217; (it was wet, but still working) and &#8216;Have you eaten dinner?&#8217; (No.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Later today, I reluctantly travel back south. My eyes are still red from spending last night crying against his shoulder. Saying goodbye to him will be even more difficult than saying goodbye to the mountains and capricious (or occasionally crepuscular) weather.</content>

    <content type="html">Here are some more photos from hiking and driving up north. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
These are all unedited, though the vibrant colours tend to suggest otherwise ^_^. The weather was (mostly) on my side, and for that, I am profoundly thankful.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;m still crashing at my border-country friend&#8217;s house. He won&#8217;t accept money, but I make myself useful by cooking nourishing meals and cleaning cameras, amongst several other things he dislikes doing for himself.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
He refuses to let me leave until I feel ready enough to face whatever mess awaits me south of the mountains. He&#8217;s good, and kind, and quiet. I will miss our comfortable silences.</content>

    <title>Moon rock</title>
    <content type="html">Oftentimes, I try to revisit places I like in all four seasons. The nuances of light and climate mean I never truly experience the same view twice.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Because of the distance it takes to travel up, I have only ever managed to see this quaint fishing village in darkness. And before the sun rises, it&#8217;s always time to set off.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5130591265/" title="The night-fisher by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5130591265_343777524a.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There was some success, though. This is the remotest part of the mainland. I was last here in April.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5130593281/" title="Moon rock by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/5130593281_9652e6171a.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The landscape is eerily lunar and strewn with ribbons of dried-up rivers and ox-bow lakes. How apt, then, that the daybreak glow of late October was bright enough to illuminate my photos, but not so to obscure the slow-dipping full moon.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>All I'm good at</title>
    <content type="html">It rained heavily for most of yesterday. My border-country friend was stressed; too engulfed by his work to feel the damp chill crawling up the walls. When the sun eventually rolled through the wet fog, I offered to walk his dog, a black Labrador Retriever, because I knew he wouldn&#8217;t find the time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thorn and I covered about five miles in total, passing leisurely from one village to another via the forest track. He was a delight to walk, and (with permission from my friend), I let him off the lead once we&#8217;d reached a quiet clearing, where we began to play fetch. I decided to take a running kick for the ball, but my right knee slipped in its joint, and I collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(Some of you who have read me from the beginning may remember an operation I underwent last year for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondritis_dissecans"&gt;Osteochondritis Dissecans&lt;/a&gt;, which stemmed from a hockey match injury at the age of sixteen. My weakened right knee will only ever have about 75% functionality on a good day, and I can&#8217;t kneel on it, nor run at any speed. This news was hard to take for a teenager who once had the potential to compete as a cross-country athlete.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My instinctive reaction was to stand up again, but I couldn&#8217;t. There was a worryingly familiar clunking feeling beneath the patella. A lady walked past with a Highland Terrier, and Thorn (who had sat protectively beside me as I winced) rushed to greet it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&#8216;Get your fucking dog away from my dog,&#8217; she (unnecessarily) retorted. I tried to call Thorn over, but he (as dogs are wont to do) put blinkers on and continued playfully gambolling with the terrier. It was clear that I was injured, but she proceeded to curse aggressively. Eventually I managed to raise myself and grasp Thorn&#8217;s collar, but not before being told that I was a &#8216;thoroughly incompetent owner.&#8217;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Upset, I called my friend, who drove over immediately and lifted me into the car. Back home, he carried me up the stairs and helped me limp out of my muddy clothes, into pyjamas. He wrapped my knee in a cold compress and brewed Earl Grey tea. Work was postponed for the rest of the evening.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Despite my friend&#8217;s quiet (but genuine) insistence that he wasn&#8217;t irritated, I have never felt so guilty for disturbing someone before, nor have I ever been made to feel so unjustly inadequate by a complete stranger.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This morning, my knee feels better. It&#8217;s red and swollen, but the joint isn&#8217;t rubbing anymore and I can walk without howling. Sometimes, I wonder if all I&#8217;m good at is being a burden to others.</content>

    <title>Home away from home</title>
    <content type="html">I was supposed to return home today, but there are problems I don&#8217;t want to (don&#8217;t know how to) face. My border-country friend, despite taking the last week off to travel around with me, is kindly letting me stay up north with him (and use his office space). As (insufficient) payment, there&#8217;s a cinnamon-apple cake rising in the oven.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He works very early most mornings, and locks himself away to write most evenings. I expect to be left to my own devices this week: walking and thinking. Unable to drive, I can&#8217;t stray farther than the beech and elm limits of the village, but this suits me fine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/5113765039/" title="Where I walk by Folkjokeopus, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1230/5113765039_ddeb7f4188.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This holiday has turned into a hiding-place. I&#8217;m not especially missed by anyone, but things are woefully amiss nonetheless, and can only be ignored for so long.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Photos from the last week will slowly manifest here, and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48654471@N03/"&gt;on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, I expect. </content>
