    <title>Veteran's Day</title>
    <content type="html">
I had a dream I was in Iraq again...&lt;br/&gt;
And America turned it into a heavily guarded theme park like Six Flags...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When I told my lieutenant that I had to go save my roommate from being shot in the head, all the lieutenant had to say was, "You forgot to salute me, soldier."

&lt;p&gt;Christ.&lt;br/&gt;
I hate to get all serious, because right now &#8220;all serious&#8221; is the last thing i need to be getting about anything right now.&lt;br/&gt;
But.&lt;br/&gt;
I think i may have a bit of a dilemma.  Or, something that could quite easily become a dilemma if i don&#8217;t sit down and get really honest with myself and the two men that seem to be playing a fairly signifigant role in my life at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s my problem.  &lt;br/&gt;
On the one hand, we have Inuk.  If you&#8217;ve been reading recently, you know he is the Friend whom i&#8217;ve known for almost 20 years, and with whom i&#8217;ve been having really incredible, fantastic, incomparably amazing sex with for the past couple months.&lt;br/&gt;
He&#8217;s razor-sharp, witty, acerbic, funny, and an amazing artist, although he&#8217;d flip me the finger if he heard me call him that in front of anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;
We&#8217;re not in a &#8220;relationship&#8221;,  but we are very close friends and i love him.&lt;br/&gt;
I may even be &lt;i&gt;in love&lt;/i&gt; with him.&lt;br/&gt;
(Whatever the fuck THAT means&#8230;)&lt;br/&gt;
But.&lt;br/&gt;
He&#8217;s not the sort that a girl can very easily imagine having any kind of viable future with, as in having things follow any kind of usual, conventional progression of co-habitation and such.&lt;br/&gt;
He drinks.  Kind of a lot.  Maybe not the best thing for me. &lt;br/&gt;
He isn&#8217;t very good at the whole Boyfriend thing.  He has no real ambition, he&#8217;s difficult.&lt;br/&gt;
But i understand him.  I KNOW him, better than any other man on the planet.  &lt;br/&gt;
This is because we are a lot alike.  &lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;m also not very good at the whole Girlfriend thing.&lt;br/&gt;
I like my autonomy.  I like my freedom.  I like not having to answer to anyone.&lt;br/&gt;
And the sex is&#8230;&lt;br/&gt;
Well. &lt;br/&gt;
And when i say i may even be &#8220;in love&#8221;, well - at one point in history we actually said those words to each other.&lt;br/&gt;
A long time ago.  &lt;br/&gt;
It&#8217;s never entirely died, at least for me.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean i want marriage, kids, house, blah blah blah.&lt;br/&gt;
Frankly, i&#8217;m not entirely sure what i want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my life is in serious flux.  And what Inuk and i have right now is just about all i am able to handle, when it comes down to it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we have Miller (Or, AM).   &lt;br/&gt;
Now, Miller and i share in common a recent tragic death.  Nearly a year ago, his wife died.&lt;br/&gt;
Nearly five months ago, i lost my son.&lt;br/&gt;
Miller is responsible, intelligent, older;   he&#8217;s sweet and funny and quirky.  &lt;br/&gt;
He&#8217;s the head of the Lit department at a private high school.&lt;br/&gt;
I find him attractive, but in a very different way than Inuk. &lt;br/&gt;
There is no gut-twisting DESIRE, with Miller.  &lt;br/&gt;
He&#8217;s not dangerous, in the way Inuk is.  &lt;br/&gt;
If things progressed, he&#8217;d take the conventional route of courting, engagement, marriage, stability&#8230;&lt;br/&gt;
In other words, the type of guy i never go for.&lt;br/&gt;
But have always been curious about.&lt;br/&gt;
Because, to be perfectly honest, i think maybe one day i&#8217;d LIKE that kind of stability.&lt;br/&gt;
At least&#8230;part of me thinks so.&lt;br/&gt;
 (Mimi would pointedly remind me at this juncture that i have &#8220;anti-contentment issues&#8221;, and that she&#8217;s been telling me for years now that i have to treat my instincts in reverse; meaning, if i&#8217;m gut-wrenchingly attracted to a man, i should run the other way.  If he doesn&#8217;t make my pulse race, and i merely &#8220;like&#8221; him, i should seriously consider dating him.  But i digress).&lt;br/&gt;
And he wants to date me.&lt;br/&gt;
But i know he&#8217;s not ready.  He is trying to be, because he really likes me a lot, and is very attracted to me. &lt;br/&gt;
When i saw him this evening, he drove me home after a quick bite and stopped the car and told me he&#8217;d like me to come over some night to hang out&#8230;the implication being it would not just be &#8220;burgers&#8221;.  &lt;br/&gt;
I told him, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s just see what happens&#8230;take things one day at a time, OK?&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Yes, i have been, i think i&#8217;m a lot more ready than i was a couple months ago&#8230;&#8221; (we&#8217;d had an actual date, and things got a little physical, but neither of us were able to go through with it.  Our minds were, respectively, elsewhere).&lt;br/&gt;
And then he said, &lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;I find myself thinking about you a lot&#8230;&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Miller!   That&#8217;s sweet!  That&#8217;s good, i mean i&#8230;i like hanging out with you, too&#8230;&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
And then i sort of got tongue tied because i thought about Inuk and my brain just shut down.&lt;br/&gt;
What the Hell is going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know Miller would be a great person to be in a relationship with.  I like him, i actually do.&lt;br/&gt;
When i type that, i know it to be true.&lt;br/&gt;
Before things started heating up with Inuk and i, Miller was the guy i was drawn to, if in a kind of strange, confused way, since it was so close to Jamie&#8217;s death, and most of why we became close was because we shared a tragedy in common.&lt;br/&gt;
However, that&#8217;s the whole thing - his wife has only been dead a year, this month.  My son&#8217;s been gone five months. &lt;br/&gt;
To me, the whole thing seems a bit precipitous.&lt;br/&gt;
And i&#8217;m not ready to dive into anything with anyone, apart from what i&#8217;ve got going on with Inuk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk is exciting and fantastic and all, but he&#8217;s also familiar.&lt;br/&gt;
Comfortable.&lt;br/&gt;
I know what to expect.&lt;br/&gt;
And i also know that my feelings for him need closer inspection.&lt;br/&gt;
Or rather, they just need time to breathe.&lt;br/&gt;
Most likely, if i were to get all serious on him now, he&#8217;d not know what to do.&lt;br/&gt;
But if we just keep going as we are, and let things just develop naturally, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, i can see that i&#8217;m being given a choice, when and if i&#8217;m ready for it, between stability, contentment and calm with a sweet, emotionally strong man whose feelings i&#8217;d never have to question and who makes me feel wonderfully good about myself, and a not-so stable (at least financially - i think he&#8217;s worse off than me) situation with my best guy-friend, for whom i have intense (yet familiar) feelings and unbelievably incredible chemistry with.  Who makes no demands on me but is always there for me when i need him.  And who also frustrates me and drives me bloody crazy, sometimes.  And with whom i might actually be in love&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaah!  Stabbing bloody eyes out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the whole thing is just freaking me out.&lt;br/&gt;
When Miller said that to me tonight , i felt myself internally going &lt;i&gt;whoa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh my god, please&#8230;please just kill the motor a minute!  Too much, too soon!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i need to be very clear about that with him.  &lt;br/&gt;
Do i like him?  Yes.  Do i think we could have a good time dating?  Yes.&lt;br/&gt;
And i know he&#8217;d treat me like a queen, and all those nice things.&lt;br/&gt;
But.  I&#8217;m not ready for this with him.  &lt;br/&gt;
And this could get way too complicated if i&#8217;m not careful. In fact, it seems it already IS getting complicated.&lt;br/&gt;
Because while i DO have a nice time with Miller when we hang out, to be honest, i&#8217;m just not ready to stop things with Inuk.&lt;br/&gt;
Not at all.  I&#8217;m having way too much fun.   &lt;br/&gt;
I believe that, especially now, there is a big part of me that truly &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; the raunchy, dirty, mattress-killing honest to goodness &lt;i&gt;fucking&lt;/i&gt; that i&#8217;m getting with Inuk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i&#8217;m really not much for juggling two men.&lt;br/&gt;
I can barely handle one.  &lt;br/&gt;
And anything more serious in my life than what i&#8217;ve got going on with Inuk, well it&#8217;s just way, &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too soon for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh.  I hate these fucking situations.  &lt;br/&gt;
I frankly don&#8217;t know how the Hell i get myself into them.&lt;br/&gt;
I wish i could click my heels, twitch my nose, do the little Genie head-shake  and make everything simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  And i&#8217;d also like a pony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll just be one of those people who you had during a rough time, someone you could talk to and would listen, someone there. I hope that you care about me, and I know you do to some extent. I just wish you cared about me half as much as I care about you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://equinox.codexed.com/2010/11/04/holy-sounds"&gt;Equinox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I could curl up inside her ass like a warm little Snuggie and hibernate for the rest of my days. Or until she had to shit. What I'm trying to say, minus that weird part about the Snuggie and fecal matter, is that I was thrilled.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://whoregagger.codexed.com/2010/11/10/chairs-attack-pt-2"&gt;WhoreGagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are unlikely to make the mistake of being vulnerable with me again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2010/11/08/bullshit"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to throw a brick through a window. To write the words &#8220;Love is not lost, you buried it with your heart and refuse to dig it up.&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morphinekisses.codexed.com/2010/11/10/stars-and-snowflakes-everything-falls-apart"&gt;MorphineKisses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good intention is innocent: stay up and create. My mistake is pausing, allowing myself to feel the weight of eyes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morsmordre.codexed.com/2010/11/09/and-just-maybe-im-to-blame-for-all-ive-heard"&gt;MorsMordre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve been sober of this&lt;br/&gt;
punch-drunk young love&lt;br/&gt;
for long&lt;br/&gt;
(too long)&lt;br/&gt;
now&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://silence.codexed.com/2010/11/09/stale"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The weight is not that of the weapon," he told her. "It is the responsibility that wielding the weapon places upon you. One day, you will feel it here, too." He had placed a finger against her chest where her heart was.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aflyingkiwi.codexed.com/2010/11/05/wielding"&gt;AFlyingKiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have a daughter, she's going to break my fuckin heart.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://el_warmachine.codexed.com/2010/11/09/spawn"&gt;El_Warmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your heart will began to pick up its pace, notifying you that something isn&#8217;t right.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pausethetragicending.codexed.com/2010/11/07/how-far-weve-come"&gt;PauseTheTragicEnding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have explored you,&lt;br/&gt;
my fingers skimming sideways&lt;br/&gt;
and sailing smoothly&lt;br/&gt;
on your middle latitudes,&lt;br/&gt;
the tropics betwixt your breasts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://recalescence.codexed.com/2010/11/07/longitudinal"&gt;Recalescence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are meant to be, right? Two halves composing one meaning - the meaning being two people invested in the other.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://secondhandheart.codexed.com/2010/11/07/my-god-she-said"&gt;SecondHandHeart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe its time to to stop worrying what could go wrong and think more of what could happen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://greencrayons.codexed.com/2010/11/07/the-great-escape"&gt;GreenCrayons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess these are resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://plainwrap.codexed.com/2010/11/04/guar-gum"&gt;Plainwrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don't know how to control my anger and it is, in turn, controlling me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://windinthewillows.codexed.com/2010/11/05/fool"&gt;WindintheWillows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see this? this is the place where your hand was, before we remembered we had pockets, before we remembered all the things that weren't right at all in between them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://exempt.codexed.com/2010/11/07/untitled-2"&gt;Exempt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fuck crash&lt;br/&gt;
fuck the 60&#8217;s&lt;br/&gt;
fuck the economy&lt;br/&gt;
fuck teamwork&lt;br/&gt;
fuck comma splices&lt;br/&gt;
my heart is ready to pop&lt;br/&gt;
and my eyes are crossing&lt;br/&gt;
and it&#8217;s just so hard&lt;br/&gt;
to eat shit&lt;br/&gt;
by the bushel&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>the apple doesn't fall far from the tree</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, last night while i was sitting in &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=113990565306948&amp;set=o.145149512176"&gt;Cunneen&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; with The Devil (and by the way, if you click the link, that&#8217;s me sitting in the corner, in my unfortunate short dark hair phase.  We will not speak of this.  Also, it was like, noon and the place was deserted because it just opened and  i was drinking coffee.  My dad took the photo.  I&#8217;m not THAT pathetic), having a nice glass (3) of red wine to soothe the savage Evil Exploding Uterus, when i get a very bizarre text from dad, aka The Father Thing.   &lt;br/&gt;
A little background information:  he just got a new, snazzy supercomputer cellphone, which confounds him on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disturbingly enough, this sort of exchange is not uncommon, which leads me to believe that, although Father Thing isn&#8217;t my biological father, we&#8217;re clearly of the same ilk:&lt;br/&gt;
(All misspellings, et al,  are left as is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dad:  Phone is suddenly very small with giamt protuding button.  And it&#8217;s slippery to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  What. The. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: It,s very sensative.  The slightest move on my part sends it to the internet and taking pictures and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Are you drunk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: My phone has gone crazy.  Or fingers are blimps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: WHY ARE YOUR FINGERS SWOLLEN UP?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: I was lieing down tryin to hold a book and text.  That was the prob&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  What is going on over there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: AND the phone is super sensative&#8230;cant let a finger get near the screen or poof&#8230;off it goes to electro land&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Put the phone down.  Go make inappropriate comments on facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: Just hit a button with the picture of a house on iit..oops..that&#8217;s the camera&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What the hell is going on over there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5165225864/" title="joe by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5165225864_dd08036d1c.jpg" width="351" height="265" alt="joe" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(Dad, looking like Julia Childs for some reason)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad:  There&#8230;did u saee that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Oh my GOD :)&#8230;lie down.  I&#8217;ll be there soon.  No more pretty mushrooms or pills for you&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad:  Aprapo&#8230;there i&#8217;m awake now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Dear god. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: What&#8217;s with the god stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  (and here, The Devil grabs my phone:)  Fuck god.  I want something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad:  The great and wonderous POOBAH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Yes, that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad: Must go to back porch for fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Must seek therapy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you understand why i&#8217;m completely off my nut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chairs Attack! Pt. 2</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;...But before it got very weird, I said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: Lisa! I almost just died a terrible death in the ER! Terrorists were throwing terrorist chairs and terror stools and terrible couches and other sit-y things! And I got hit! And I have a bruise!  But I didn't die because I have very dateable qualities such as: being strong, being a good listener, caring about the same shit you care about and, most importantly, having an average sized penis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I embellished the story with terrorists and average sized penises, don't judge me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to make Chair Fest '10 as epic as my creative brain-juices could allow. My chair-to-the-head story had to be  so awe-inspiring and Indiana Jones Worthy that Lisa would have no other recourse than dropping her panties and going Penthouse Letters on my ween.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or I'd just settle for a pity fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or she could just lay there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, after I had told the story at least 8 different ways (One involved me single handedly stopping an armed jewelery heist and another where I fended off nazi-pirates with nothing but a fork, some pencil eraser and a prayer), I eventually revealed the kinda, sorta truth: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Batman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seemed to do the goddamn trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She kissed me. 4 times. Just the right amount of tongue. Just the right amount of grind-age. God, I love that woman. Sometimes I wish I could curl up inside her ass like a warm little Snuggie and hibernate for the rest of my days. Or until she had to shit. What I'm trying to say, minus that weird part about the Snuggie and fecal matter, is that I was thrilled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd have taken at leeeeast 6 more chairs to the head for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then it got weird. You know, my cliffhanger from laster-Gag?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: @, holy shit. I have to tell you what I did last night. Ok, this is weird and everything and I don't know how it happened really...But last night I got drunk with my best friend SARA...And we kissed each other. We made out a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now immediately, before my mouth opened to reply, my PENIS and my BRAIN had this conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PENIS: Me want to go inside pretty girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAIN: Don't be a dick, Penis! Do not rise to this occasion! THIS IS A BAD THING! You thought it was hard to get with her before??? Just think about having to deal with boys &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; girls!!! And where does she get off making out with her bff??? I have been trying to make out with her since we broke up!!! Penis, we must make an example of her!!! You must...Not...Get...Haaaaaaard!!!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PENIS: Me feeling a growth spurt cumming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAIN: Penis! You ass!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knew my PENIS and BRAIN had such compelling and double entendre conversations? And that's when I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: What about &lt;a href=http://whoregagger.codexed.com/2010/06/03/be-yonce-belief&gt;Beyonce&lt;/a&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: Don't get weird about this. It was just a thing! It just happened! I wasn't being, like, a dirty slut or anything. I have known SARA since I was 12. We are best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: Fine! Then we can be best friends too! I'd love to be your best friend! We can best friend it up! Makin' out and whatnot like two best friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I just said there? That best friend bit? That was about to bite me in the ass. I'll segue by saying that Lisa is not an idiot. Lisa is, in fact, very smart. But have you ever been around someone long enough that you kind of take for granted their smart-ness? Like you sort of forget that they're intelligent until BAM! one day they just say some mother-fucking shit that rocks your world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of those times. Because she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: WAIT! Hold the fucking phone! 2 years ago you told me that you and I could &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be best friends because you didn't want me to start thinking of you like a brother or a weird cousin or something! You said that! Yeah, I just caught your ass!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy. Fucking. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She got me! She really fucking got me! All the bullshit philosophy I've said to her over the 4 years I've known her...SHE ACTUALLY REMEMBERS IT! What the goddamn hell??? How could my own sayings and teachings betray me at such a crucial, bi-sexually odd moment???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God I hope this kissing chicks thing is just a phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that she at least tapes it and gives me a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do get lonely, you know.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Chairs Attack!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was attacked by a raging, meth-addicted psychotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He threw a chair at my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many other Codexed journals can you read today that have that catchy of an opening, huh? That was like the Jaws of openers, wasn't it? Bitch just got ate. But don't get me wrong, I'm not gloating over here. I'm not better than you because I almost got chair'd to death.  I mean, have you ever been attacked by a raging, meth-addicted, chair throwing psychotic? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only sounds like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when I was at work delivering this certain item down to the ER. I was having a nice little walking jaunt, working on my plans involving the ingenious and stupidity reaching Jelousy Testousy Saga and thinking about sparrows, fig newtons, rainbows and casual relations with attractive strangers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as soon as I opened the ER doors, this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHAIR --------------------------------&gt; @&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a chair thrown at my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually the back of my head, because I turned suddenly, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first intial thought wasn't "Wow! That chair hurt my back and head area very badly" it was "Wow! That chair looks exactly like the ones I used to sit on in 5th grade!" And it was true! That thing  was the same orange, plastic, 3-slits down the back chair that held every grade school kids ass from 1975 to 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flashback, baby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I was quickly shoved very violently from my childhood 80's history when I noticed the aforementioned raging, meth-addicted psychotic who threw the chair. He was, by then, now throwing his bed, table and lamp. What a champ! It took about 6 police guards to subdue the crazy bastard. It was kinda funny, in a very disfunctional and arousing way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that was just my chair'd head talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was questioned by the Po-Po who asked if I was alright and whether or not I wanted to press charges. And I was questioned by a few Hospital Administration Boys who seemed to be taking this far more seriously than I was. Hell, I was already thinking about Gagging it here on Codexed. I knew I was going to throw in a Jaws reference too. To prove that, here's the text I sent &#169; right after getting into my chair-y squabble:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy187/thegaggers/chair.jpg" border="0" alt="Chair'd!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was only one more way to make this chair throwing day even more epically inclined. And hopefully you can guess how: by using this sob-story to try and impress Lisa in the hopes of making out with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's just what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only thing was, things were about to get very weird...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>blood, guts and attack-squirrels </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you will, starting your day off with this news the moment you walk into work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have to run!  Hannah got attacked by a squirrel!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah is big-sister of Piglet, incidentally.  As we were giggling maniacally (once we knew she was not missing an eye or seriously hurt - just a scratch), all i could think of is how Jamie would have fallen on the floor in hysterics (after making sure she was alright, of course).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A &lt;i&gt;squirrel&lt;/i&gt;?  Who gets attacked by SQUIRRELS??&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/5161720647_814d6216e3_m.jpg" width="240" height="227" alt="evilsquirrel2" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Evil Squirrel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&#8217;s at the doctor&#8217;s office getting tetanus shot as i write this.  Poor kid.  &lt;br/&gt;
Apparently, she was throwing away a coffee-cup in a garbage can on the street - when she lifted up the lid, she and the squirrel startled each-other.  She screamed, the squirrel screamed, then jumped on her face.&lt;br/&gt;
She&#8217;s laughing about it though, in typical Hannah-Style.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as one might expect, that was just the start to a very bizarro day indeed.&lt;br/&gt;
After the squirrel-fiasco,  i decided it would be a perfect day to take Piglet to this gigantic park, which is about an hour away on foot.  I love to walk, Piglet loves to be escorted around in his stroller, so off we went on our adventure.  We were also meeting the little Pug, the newborn who is to be my next Nannying gig, and his mom.  &lt;br/&gt;
Now, if you&#8217;ve been paying attention (you have, haven&#8217;t you??), i&#8217;m currently surfing the Crimson Wave (sorry, Male-Tribe people, but there you have it).  I&#8217;m not sure if i&#8217;ve mentioned it before, but i don&#8217;t bleed like a normal person.  &lt;br/&gt;
Whereas most women lose the equivalent of a shot-glass of blood per day, i lose about the equivalent of a 5th of Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the whole idea of walking for nearly an hour with no public restrooms in sight (it&#8217;s a residential neighborhood) is a fairly dumb one.  But see, here&#8217;s the thing;  i&#8217;m losing such vast quantities of blood that my reasoning is a bit impaired.  I&#8217;m rather like an incredibly vapid cheerleader after doing gravity-bong hits followed by an afternoon of bingeing and purging.  &lt;br/&gt;
So anyway, of course i think this little adventure is a good idea and off we go.  Everything is going fine, Piglet is having a blast, the Pug is sleeping most of the time, i get to talk to Mother of Pug, it&#8217;s all just peachy.  &lt;br/&gt;
Until it&#8217;s time to walk home.&lt;br/&gt;
I hit Western, which is about 1/16th of my walk back, and realize that i&#8217;ve had a malfunction of the feminine hygiene-product variety.    Of course, it&#8217;s like 65 degrees out today so everyone&#8217;s out walking around enjoying the weather, and i&#8217;m in jeans and a t-shirt.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not looking good.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there is nowhere for me to go except home.  And anyway, since i grabbed Piglet&#8217;s backpack, and i have the attention-span of a 3-day old colt on acid, i didn&#8217;t bring any extra thingies to staunch the niagra-falls-like torrent of blood. &lt;br/&gt;
So, pretty soon, i&#8217;m walking down the street looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS23gu_nCi8M5fjsHVYLV2ZgtSMcJbzKwRAdYegCKBRMav5JRQ&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__U6nNBRYtisANkjryatyrQ-487Bc="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Me, bleeding&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i&#8217;m pushing a stroller with a 30 lb toddler in it and there&#8217;s about 35 minutes of walking ahead of me.  So what do i do?  &lt;br/&gt;
I start sending graphic texts to my friend Alaska, who is, of course, a guy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me:  Why does God hate me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A:  Um&#8230;what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&#8217;m at Western/Lunt &amp; just bled through my fucking jeans. I have a long, gross walk ahead of me :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Ugh.  Anything i can do?  From my apartment like, 40 minutes away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Take my uterus out &amp; stab it with a spear until it dies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Um, wow, no lunch for me.  Also, don&#8217;t have a spear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  You can eat it if you want but i&#8217;d grill it first.  With fava beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A:  How about fried?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  You&#8217;re gross&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A:  &#8220;Fried&#8221; is what you&#8217;re calling gross in this conversation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Ugh.  I look like i had a coat-hanger abortion&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed. &lt;br/&gt;
And  then just when i think it can&#8217;t get much worse, Piglet pipes up from his stroller - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Diaper Change!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Uh-oh, Piglet - are you wet, or did you poop?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poop.  Wet.  Diaper Change.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bloody Hell&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we get home, it&#8217;s all like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRgsKrfN59EjLHd--BezuXyIMU1aJLRkUKJzFtGb33ug4sFX5Y&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__RM10Ck5jJygBmAbE0s1tVPUISCk="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, i&#8217;m thinking if i make it through the next hour and a half without having to be tied down in a padded room, i&#8217;ll call it a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PS  - Jesus, i thought i got weird shit with my random image-googles in the past - try &#8220;insane cartoon cheerleader&#8221;.  &lt;br/&gt;
I mean, my &lt;b&gt;goodness&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>swamp things and mermaids and the crimson wave</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that my period makes me  completely insane.&lt;br/&gt;
I mean, not that i mind the situation that inspired the last two entries, because ultimately i did, despite my hormone-induced crazies,  manage to find the humour in them; and ultimately, it lead to a very useful discussion and clearing-of-the-air between Inuk and i.  &lt;br/&gt;
So, once again, i Learned Something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if there was a way to illustrate an example of Normal Me and PMS Me (which is not to be confused with Riding the Crimson Wave Me, which is much more benign), it would look something like this (and all these photos are selfportraits, so we have VERACITY!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Normal Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/4727708487/" title="I'm Back, Bitches by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1419/4727708487_377a4daa7e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="I'm Back, Bitches" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see that i am a normal, happy and reasonable-looking girl.   Despite the turquoise hair, i have an air of sanity and well being about me.&lt;br/&gt;
But then, right around the beginning of the month, PMS kicks in and The Metamorphosis begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5159294852/" title="calyptra by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/5159294852_917f76a4f0_m.jpg" width="193" height="240" alt="calyptra" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may note here that i am looking a bit strange - black, wiry hair springs from my head and i begin to sprout giant evil Insanity Moths from my back.  Which leads to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMS me - aka &#8220;La Bruja&#8221;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5032809/" title="La Bruja by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/5/5032809_7b3af68f86_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="La Bruja" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this incarnation (which means &#8220;The Witch&#8221; in Spanish), which is when the transformation is complete and right before i start surfing the Crimson Wave, is when the evil Insanity Moths have laid their eggs in my brain, which hatch and then begin to take over and cause me to think the smallest incidents are a personal attack against me, and that everyone on the planet, in particular the people closest to me - ESPECIALLY if they are male and i am having lots of great sex with them, HATE ME FOREVER.&lt;br/&gt;
And they must be destroyed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the Time of Shame and Remorse, which is when, the moment i start bleeding, my sanity snaps sharply back into focus and i look back in loathing and horror at the carnage i wreaked as La Bruja.   &lt;br/&gt;
Which looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nooooo&#8230;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5159338464/" title="loathing by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1322/5159338464_014b75d899_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="loathing" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there you have the journey of my monthly cycle.    It&#8217;s not a journey you want to take with me.  At least not lately.&lt;br/&gt;
But for some reason, Inuk does not want to kill me yet - instead he is Nice.  &lt;br/&gt;
What is wrong with him?&lt;br/&gt;
Here is how the conversation goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk:  If you can make it to Cunneen&#8217;s in 15 minutes i can make some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: (filled with trepidation and horror and dread) Ok!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we proceed to exchange dirty texts, which tells me things are pretty much ok.&lt;br/&gt;
When i arrive at the Pub, Piglet is with me and it&#8217;s not technically open yet so we have the place to ourselves.&lt;br/&gt;
He opens the door, greets Piglet and kisses me.  He informs me he hasn&#8217;t been home yet (he worked the closing shift, and then cleans the bar in the morning: he stayed and watched movies and got shit-hammered).  So he&#8217;s drunk and i&#8217;m just waking up and drinking coffee.   He says something along the lines of, &#8220;So, er, about the other night.  Are you OK?  I mean,  tell me what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize and tell him that it had nothing really to do with him, but with my Insanity Moths.  &lt;br/&gt;
He then reminds me of another reason i might have been not quite sane at the time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, yes, there&#8217;s that, but&#8230;well what i was thinking is you seemed to hit a wall when J&#8217;s friend asked you if you had any children&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes.  That.  It was the first time someone asked me that question since Jamie&#8217;s death.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah&#8230;well, i guess that sort of put me someplace i wasn&#8217;t prepared to be on a friday night over drinks at the bar&#8230;and then A. walked me to Piglet&#8217;s for the dinner thing and wanted to &#8216;talk&#8217;, which made me think he was going to want to discuss his feelings for me, and why i&#8217;ve been so standoffish and avoiding him, and i was irritated with YOU for not being there&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk looks at me for a moment and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You know, if there is ANYTHING that i ever do that upsets you, will you please tell me?  I mean i know it&#8217;s not your fault that everyone assumed you and i had a fight, that was unavoidable because of fucking Goatboy opening his fucking mouth about the two of us, and then you walk in all upset and Nate says what he said to you about &#8216;what did Inuk do&#8217;, and you just had all this crap happen within the past hour&#8230;but&#8230;well, if there is any role i played beyond that, like if something is wrong between us, or there&#8217;s something you want to discuss regarding us&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inuk, i know&#8230;and thank you so much for understanding.  And this is why i just wanted to wait til the PMS Insanity was over, because i was being totally irrational and part of me knew that and yes, i was a bit upset that you weren&#8217;t coming to the dinner that night but i shouldn&#8217;t have taken it personally&#8230;i&#8217;m sorry&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, as i said - you were having a great time, and then that question about having children came at you out of left field, and i saw how it hit you.  And then i said i wasn&#8217;t coming to dinner, and really i just wasn&#8217;t in the mood to shift gears and go into Piglet and his Family mode, you know?  I wanted to keep the party mode going from Johannah&#8217;s birthday and stay out&#8230;i can see how it might make you upset because it was just one more thing, and you had to deal with A, and you were PMSing&#8230;i completely get all that.  SO&#8230;we&#8217;re ok?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re OK.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the man just as insane as me for being so understanding (only insane in the opposite way, which is to be unreasonably nice in the face of my Psycho Insanity-Moth Hose-beast mode)?&lt;br/&gt;
I don&#8217;t know.  But, either way, i was reminded that the best way to deal with my irrational PMS crap is to&#8230;duh&#8230;TALK about what&#8217;s going on with Inuk so i can get some kind of fucking Reality Check.&lt;br/&gt;
It&#8217;s true that this Insanity Moth thing has pretty much only been going on since Jamie&#8217;s death&#8230;and i told Inuk as much.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because i keep it all inside constantly, put on my face of &#8216;everything&#8217;s cool&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When of course it&#8217;s anything BUT cool&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes - and then when the hormones hit, it&#8217;s like the floodgates are let loose&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And then you have to deal with J&#8217;s friend asking if you have kids, and you&#8217;ve not had to answer that question yet since Jamie died&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes.  It&#8217;s a recipe for disaster.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he surreptitiously grabbed my breasts and kissed me while Piglet played under the pool table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So - are you coming to hang out with me during my shift tonight, so i can take you home and do filthy things to you?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Uh&#8230;YES.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Good.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, very good indeed.  &lt;br/&gt;
I act like a maniac, then get treated like a human being and will be getting seriously laid, to boot.&lt;br/&gt;
You are crazy, Inuk.  I hope this isn&#8217;t all just a ruse so you can hack me up with a flensing-blade in my sleep&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Jealousy Testousy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get inspiration from beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will confess that, I, Prince @tty, am not the first man-ling in human history to experience a drunken thought-process that is so dynamic, so brilliant and so apotheosis reaching that both Issac Newton &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Issac Hayes would take notice. But! I am one of the few dumb-asses in human history that wake up totally and completely sober thinking my drunken thoughts were pure gold, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lets rewind the clock to this conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: I've got a date tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: Good for you! I'm glad you're getting out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: Not the reaction I'm going for, butt-hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: Well what do you want me to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: That you love me. That I am your world. That I'm cute, funny, smart and you'd be a fool to let me go on this date. And that I have a great beard. Also, if you'd like to throw out any random foreshadowing about us being naked together in the near future, I wouldn't mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: I do agree with most it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@: YOU CAN'T JUST PRETEND TO BE JEALOUS???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa: Nope. I'm with my boyfriend right now blah, blah, blah and I blah, blah, blah you and I blah, blah, blah I do love you blah blah blah we will be together when I can blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the gist of that little convo? I tried to get Lisa to be jealous of this date I was going on with a very lovely little lady named JANE. BUT NO! She wouldn't even pretend to be jealous. What the fuck? Everybody gets jealous. Ghandi got jealous. Jesus got jealous. Jay Leno got jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets fast-forward the VHS tape a litte further to that night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tipsy. Like I said, I was getting my inspiration from beer. And that's when I came up with these thoughts: Lisa is not jealous because I am not trying hard enough to make her jealous. I need to go Jealous Hard with a vengence. I need to get my jeal on. I gotta be jeal-in. I gotta...Nope, I'm out of words to put jealous in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next golden thought was...I should ask out one of her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DING! DING! DING! DING! WE HAVE A WINNER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I couldn't be rude about it, exactly. To Lisa's friend, I mean. I'm not a huuuuuge asshole. I'm just a needy dick. There's a dif. But if I could fanagle one of Lisa's close friends to go out on a date with me under the pre-text that it was all an 8th grade ploy to exact a jealously plot...I could make Lisa jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then this equation could happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa seeing me on a date with her bff + Me hamming it up in front of Lisa with Lisa's bff and acting like a total dick like I know she likes her men + That old 8th grade luck + Booze + Immaturity to the 5th power + Luck in general + Lisa feeling sorry for me + Lisa pity-ing me + Me telling a killer joke at just the right time ='s Me and Lisa together for a few more months of harmony and realtions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are one of those Judgemental Judge Judy's that thinks this plan is really fucking stupid and I would probably be better off and happier to have just gotten serious with my date JANE and forgotten Lisa and her drama and you think I may've sprung some kind of brain leak and am in need of at least 7,000 dollars of psychaitric help...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you just don't get me do you?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bathroom Blues</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Hosp got rid of my favorite bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not seem like a big deal to you, but trust me that bathroom had charm. It was seedy, ill lit and pine fresh. It was creepy as hell, really. Nobody wanted to piss in there. It actually looked like a torture chamber of some kind. There were oddly assorted stains on the walls and whatnot. Who knew what those were! They could've been all number of fecal, brain or otherwise unsavory matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, charm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it because I could just venture in there and pop a squat with my favorite Harry Bosch novel and call it a day. Nobody bothered you becasue nobody wanted to meet Jigsaw in the 4th stall over and get Saw'd. Who would? Even in 3D, who would? But I really did love that little bathroom. All the graffitti was funny and just vulgar enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like I said the Hosp got rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They remodeled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would be fine if they could've remodeled it to look &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the same only &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; creepy. But they didn't! They actually made it very, very, very, very uncomfortable. How? Well, they created this bathroom to have a sensor button that automatically opens the door when a peeing person approaches. Only thing is, the hallway where the bathroom is located is a busy little intersection. Meaning: a lot of people walk by this newly revamped bathroom and accidently trigger the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning: I can see very clearly into the bathroom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy187/thegaggers/041f80c5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy187/thegaggers/041f80c5.jpg" alt="See?." width="400" height ="300" border=&#8221;0&#8221;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a glanced side-view of how far into the toilet you can actually see. If I really tried even a smidgen harder, I could've taken a pic of the back of some guys ass while he's taking a wee-wee. Whatever dumb-ass contructed this toilet area didn't make, like, a little foyer area or whatnot to block passerbys from seeing your wang. Now, every time the sensor is hit and the door swings open, you can literally see one of your friends sitting there pooping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do I want to see one of my friends pooping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not always.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>reason #573 why i should live alone in a tiny transient motel-room with a laptop and dead rat for a pet</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING!!  This was written under the influence of PMS, while i was drinking, and laughing so hard i nearly swallowed my tongue.  God help me. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon careful reflection on &lt;a href="http://selkie.codexed.com/2010/11/06/thank-you-billy-we-had-no-idea-you-were-a-cyclops"&gt;Last Night&#8217;s Apocalyptic Nose-Dive into Burning Screaming Failure and Embarassment&lt;/a&gt;,  i have decided that i will never ever have sex again for the rest of my life and possibly the next one.&lt;br/&gt;
Because, apparently, my judgement on the behaviour of men is right on par with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSY38ebZYpRchQLbX7ABoALMpYDfSw3SmfntUCFWN6KxStD6d4&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__3BZkVHmM38DDpoVDs17NtC8vQ-M="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Wrong.  AKA Justin Bieber&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, when it comes to men, i have the instincts of a 13 year-old girl&#8217;s taste in popular music.&lt;br/&gt;
By which i mean, it&#8217;s just&#8230;wrong.   &lt;br/&gt;
Because we all know what happens - girls that age invariably  get some kind of irrational crush on somebody totally inappropriate, like the boy in their English class that sets fire to small mammals,  or their cute next door neighbor who is 30 and also a convicted Paedophile with bodies dressed up as Cabbage Patch Dolls hidden in the basement.&lt;br/&gt;
Left up to me, i would be all &#8220;OoooOOo!  DOLLIES!&#8221; and blithely run down the stairs while the neighbor follows me with a flensing-blade.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I cannot be allowed to make my own decisions when it comes to men.&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because here is what happens (i have made a helpful list in order to illustrate more elegantly my predicament):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Meet Guy in Cafe (SAFE, RESPONSIBLE!  NOT A BAR!  YAY, ME!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Start talking about mutual interest in music and literature (HURRAH!  WE BOTH LIKE THE SAME OBSCURE &#8216;70s BAND AND UNDERGROUND GRAPHIC NOVELS!  HE MUST BE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT COOL AND SANE!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  Take the next decade or so getting to really know him (SEE HOW RESPONSIBLE AND ADULT I AM?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  Ignore all evidence of Guy Friend&#8217;s inability to have a viable relationship, even if it&#8217;s casual and undemanding as a pet rock.  Bonus points if you are just as bad at maintaining relationships because you find pet rocks scary. (I AM DIFFERENT!  WE WON&#8217;T BE DICKS TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE HAVE A &#8220;HISTORY&#8221;! )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.  Get involved. Tell yourself it&#8217;s &#8220;only sex&#8221;.  (NOOOOOOOOOOO&#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.  Watch as you slowly become paranoid as you perceive Guy is about to flip out on you and try to push you away  (Bonus points if that involves a very subtle and confusing maneuvering away from you whenever things get &#8220;too intense&#8221;,  that is on par with being a fucking brain-surgeon which makes you question your own sanity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.  Somehow manage to be caught off guard and hurt (Bonus points again if YOU flip out and run away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Cry alone and then embarrass yourself by going out in public too soon, where people who somehow seem to already know all about it anyway will be invariably supportive and nice to you which makes you start crying again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. Write drunken journal entry bemoaning your fate and cursing Guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.  Resolve Never To Get Involved With Guy Sexually Ever Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.  Feel yourself begin to simultaneously plot murder and cave-in when Guy texts you the next day, asking how your night was. (Always respond sarcastically with &#8220;Lovely&#8221;.  He probably won&#8217;t pick up on it, but it will make you feel better.  Proceed to have oblique texting conversation where he seems clueless and you wonder if you are over-reacting.  You probably are. Because you are crazy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12. Repeat (with same Guy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO MORE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, i am going to stay locked up in my room with my laptop and subsume myself in the safe haven of the Internet, where i will hiss at anyone in Demonic Irritation who tries to distract me, ultimately growing cybernetic tubes out of my fingers and umbilicus that connect me to the World Wide Web in a blissful union with invisible people i&#8217;ll never meet in the real world and revel in new, uncomplicated existence involving No Real Human Contact&#8230;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Forever!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Pain-Stake</title>
    <content type="html">Last night I dreamed that your family and I ended up on the same plane to Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Something was wrong so you were clumsy a lot and kept running into things, sheepishly trying not to embarrass yourself, so I helped you carry your things and hurried you and your family to the front of the boarding line.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ahead of us was one more couple, deeply in love, holding hands at the counter as they waited to go through. I looked at you and smiled at the coincidence that we'd met again, and was proud of myself for being so nice to you. You were just as well pleased. It wasn't love anymore, but it was just pleasurable to see your face again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
An extremely large black man in a black tracksuit got between us and the couple ahead of us. He had hate in his eyes. I remember he screamed,&lt;br/&gt;
"What the fuck, girl!?" at the womn, and produced a knife quite stealthily from his left wrist. I was the only one who saw it in time to warn everyone to give them space. The girl ran away at her boyfriend's demand and managed to dodge a stab.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I was calculating a way to interfere without getting too roughed up when he got a hold of his girlfriend's hair and pulled her toward him. My eyes widened and I saw you leap your small self onto the gigantic man's back, trying to hug your small arms around his thick neck. He released the woman.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The large man began to buck like a rodeo bull, one hand reaching back to shake you, the other stabbing around wildly with the blade.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
By the time I had gotten to him, he had somehow gotten you down into a headlock, gripping your neck in the inside joint of his elbow, still flailing a knife at the man he hated so much. I pulled you but his grip was too tight. I urged you to twist your body and neck so you could use your skull as leverage, but he thrashed around too wildly. I told you to try going limp, but you were too into the fight.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, I  charged the man and sent the three of us tumbling into a trashcan where he let you go and you slid against the ground, coughing and weak.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The way we fell, he was on all fours, almost completely above me, who was somewhat sprawled and disoriented.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
His arm rose high and by the time my eyes focused, I'd seen a knife blade go straight into my face.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I woke up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I can't stop shaking.&lt;br/&gt;
I fucking hate losing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>This Pizza is for Science!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night Inuk and i came to a very &lt;i&gt;Serious Realization&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
The kind of realization you come to when you discover that you and the person with whom you&#8217;ve been having regular Wild Monkey Sex have been living a Lie. &lt;br/&gt;
The Lie being that up until this point, you both sort of thought that sex was like, well, Pizza.  &lt;br/&gt;
 It&#8217;s not like, Sushi or Tapas or anything.  But it&#8217;s pretty damn good.  &lt;br/&gt;
But it&#8217;s not&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oh my fucking God&#8230;i cannot BELIEVE how amazing this Pizza is.&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
or;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;With this Incredibly Awesome Pizza - we will RULE THE WORLD!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, it&#8217;s not true, the people who say that once you&#8217;re out of your twenties, and have been having sex with a particular person (albeit on and off, sometimes with years in between) for many years, sex gets boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time Inuk and i engaged in extracurricular physical activities, we were both pretty damn young.  Like, early twenties.   It was good then - we neither of us had much in the way of inhibitions, ever.  We even like the same weird kind of porn - i.e., obscure, sick 1970&#8217;s flicks with names like &#8220;The Flea&#8221;,  or Japanese Tentacle Porn, a la &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai"&gt;Hokusai&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; woodblock print:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5149004995/" title="HokusaiDreamFishermansWife by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1183/5149004995_efe23b923c_m.jpg" width="240" height="200" alt="HokusaiDreamFishermansWife" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&#8221;The Dream of the Fisherman&#8217;s Wife&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we were also fairly young and inexperienced.  &lt;br/&gt;
But &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;?  &lt;br/&gt;
I don&#8217;t know what the Hell happened but it is &lt;i&gt;exponentially&lt;/i&gt; better now (i realize math is not sexy, but in this case it&#8217;s the only term that works) many years and lovers later.  Ok, &#8220;many&#8221; (at least in terms of lovers) is perhaps a bit of an exaggeration.  &lt;br/&gt;
But you get my drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is where we come to last night&#8217;s epiphany:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inuk: Um, you know i used to think this sort of thing was bullshit&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What Thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk: The whole &#8220;Chemistry&#8221; thing.  But i have to tell you - with you, there is absolutely no denying that we have it, and i&#8217;ve never experienced anything like it before.  I mean, i&#8217;m a grown man.  I&#8217;ve not had TONS of women, but i&#8217;ve certainly had enough to have developed the theory, over the years, that sex is sort of like Pizza&#8230;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Pizza?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk: Well, yeah - i mean even when it&#8217;s not so great, it&#8217;s still Pizza.  How wrong can you go with Pizza?  It&#8217;s good, even if it&#8217;s not so good.  And at the same time, well, it&#8217;s just Pizza.  But &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  This is like gourmet $500 Pizza special ordered from Italy and delivered by Sicilian mobsters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk:  It&#8217;s outside the realm of Pizza.  We have transcended Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: You&#8217;re damn right we have.  We&#8217;ve entered the realm of SCIENCE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuk:  Yup.  Chemistry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may be thinking,  &#8220;Who the hell have these two losers been hooking up with?  I have AWESOME sex!  Sex that will TAKE OVER THE WORLD!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe you have, maybe you haven&#8217;t.  I &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; i&#8217;d had some pretty amazing lovers in the past; but seriously, this whole thing has entered an entirely different realm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s sort of like when you are 9 years old and all you&#8217;ve ever had is Fig Newtons because your mom is a total anti-sugar hippie granola cruncher; you think &#8220;these Fig Newtons are pretty damn good!&#8221; and you even think they are viable cookies.&lt;br/&gt;
 And then your grandma sneaks you an Oreo behind her back one day and your mind is totally blown and suddenly you&#8217;re all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sfangels.com/images/Ren-%20space%20madness.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&#8221;We&#8217;re not hitchhiking anymore - we&#8217;re riding!&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything has changed.  You never want to see another Fig Newton again.  What a fool you were to think Fig Newtons were in the same UNIVERSE as an actual cookie!   &lt;br/&gt;
Give me cookies&#8230;&lt;br/&gt;
COOKIES!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s kind of like that.  &lt;br/&gt;
So you see, my little Kumquats, it&#8217;s all relative. &lt;br/&gt;
And until you have experienced the mutual desire to lick the sweat off each-others&#8217; post-coital bodies like it&#8217;s frosting and not, well, &lt;i&gt;post-coital sweat&lt;/i&gt;; or you manage to go at it for hours, like Rabid Bunny-Rabbits on Methamphetamines even after a night of little sleep and too much alcohol; or the very sight of the other person doing something utterly mundane like sweeping the floor or cooking eggs at midnight sends you careening into a Pavlovian Lust Response, then you have not had Cookies.  &lt;br/&gt;
You have been subsisting on Fig Newtons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have not experienced SCIENCE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRlg8VkKPV_Ldv5Q9HaVmIGgtqEv5MKHIBgCdnXDH9a4_6WOHM&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__7tnE_pgIDCnydHLltfBGa9Uj0ww="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Me - Never The Same Again&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS - can somebody tell me why, when you google images of &#8220;cookies cartoon&#8221;, you get about 75,000,000 pics of girls giving blowjobs?  Considering the metaphors i&#8217;ve been using in this entry, it&#8217;s just a little fucking odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say, the mind reels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sperm Painting Fun</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things get a little weird over here on WG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true, obviously, that every once in a while we'll rock out a bit of lit that is both funny, smart and poignant. Every once in a while we'll create mind-altering analogies or metaphors or observational analyses that stimulate your smart-senses and tickle your throaty ball with a humor that is both thought provoking and charmingly refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are about to get very weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't worry too much. It won't get too weird. Just think of this Gag like the "serious" episodes of your favorite television series. Like when Stephanie Tanner confided in Uncle Jesse when she found out the school bully was being abused by his father on Full House. Or when Will accidently made Carlton overdose on speed and had to confront the family when Uncle Phil was being a major dick on Fresh Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about this dream I had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now dreams and whatnot are not my specialty. That's my co-gaggers area of crazy. But last nights dream was sooooo odd and weird that I had to share with you all what by brain pan is up to in the wee hours of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the dream:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was with Lisa. Like &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; her. Dating, I suppose. And I had this idea that we weren't going to last for very long. Go figure. So, we are at home. I guess  it was &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; home, so maybe we were married, but who knows? Dreams are funky. And I get this idea: I want to get Lisa pregnant with my child. To trap her. Forever. And ever. So she can never escape me. Hahaha! I'm an evil little prick of a dreamer, eh? So I say to her, "Let's have a kid" and she is all, "No" and I was all, "F You". I figured in my dream logic that if she could have a kid with her sleezeball BF she could certaintly have a kid with me. A better kid! A funnier kid! An @ kid! Yes, I would make our kid funnier, sexier and less breast fed. But Lisa said no. So I came up with an idea. I would  spread my man-sperm all around the house. And Lisa would eventually accidently brush up against my sperm and BLAM! she would be with child. I had a large jar with the label SPERM on it. I don't know how on earth I filled that sucker up. And I had a paint brush. I went around the house painting sperm on everything. The fridge, the couch, the air conditioning unit. Seth Rogen from Superbad would've been thrilled. I'm not sure why I never though to, I don't know, just &lt;i&gt;have sex&lt;/i&gt; with her...But it's a goddamn dream!!! I was not thinking logically. Eventually Lisa went to watch tv and picked up the remote. The remote had my painted sperm on it. She asked me what the sticky stuff was on the remote. I looked guiltily at her and said...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what I said! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that really bugs me. How would I have explained that????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you just read about my dream and you think, "This little greaser is really making me sore" then I would ask why you are talking like this is 1954. But! If you just read my dream and you think, "That's only slightly weird. I've had weirder dreams in the past and I kind of think we should go on a bowling date some night" then I would ask you what size bowling shoe you wear because you better put on your Sunday Best 'cuz I'll  be there at 8, baby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said. It got weird today.&lt;/p&gt;

- Coldplay, "A Rush of Blood to the Head"&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Well, &lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/707106"&gt;my Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt;'s kinda going to crap suddenly. I've got an upwards of about 3,000 words and nothing but great concepts and ideas that I daydream about all day at work, but a sudden, massive Sociology project just got slapped onto my damn plate on top of another 15-page paper (for a goddamn 101 class) that are all due in December. College has proven to be a fair breeze up until now, and the pressure's never bothered me. It's just that when I do a paper, I don't half-ass it like the snot noses I'm surrounded by, so by the time I've gotten to sit down at Nano again, my brain is already fried gray-matter mash with a side of onions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I don't think I'll finish Nano this year. It's my first shot and well, I can honestly say I do love to write, but I lack a certain discipline that most hardcore writers seems to have. I get amazing story ideas (some of which I'm sure a few of you have been exposed to), but I tend to like my social life and how it kind of inspires me to write instead of hunkering down in front of a keyboard and praying to the great literary gods with coffee and nicotine sacrifices that an idea will develop in time. I'm still glad I at least joined and got an idea what to do and who else is in it to win it. I can see this story not being done this year, but I'll use what I have and build upon throughout the seasons either way - because I honestly think that this story has some great potential in becoming something even bigger. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anyway, just to keep myself motivated, and at least the concept of my Nano story in my head fresh, I'll give you a quick synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Travis Wright is 25, newly wed, college educated, and eager to strike out into the world and start his family fresh when he's recruited by an elite "people finding" service. The idea of being a private investigator alongside some of the nation's best connections has Travis excited that he'll be successful and fairly well to due until he realizes that his mentor and supervisor is an estranged, sociopathic, gun-totting mad man who uses extortion and blackmail to get the information he needs to satisfy clients. As the adventures to find the adopted daughter of a very wealthy client who gave her away at birth takes them deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, Travis begins to have suspicions that his mentor, Dresden, has a hidden agenda and might be pocketing a little extra on the side for something bigger than anyone can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dresden is 30. A Special Operations war veteran, a smooth talker, and a man who believes that "Sometimes ya gotta do the wrong thing to get the right thing going." He's the kind of guy that would shoot you to save the trouble of suffering... after he was the one to shoot you the first time in the name of getting the job done anyway. He is the best of the best at locating people with discretion in mind. He treats the world like his own personal war zone and will stop at nothing to get his man for the distinguished company he works for, even if it means bending the rules to the point where the stress might break them. Ever since Dresden's return from a brutal deployment in the South America, he's been different and he knows it. Now he's using his skills in the covert and deadly to rake in one of the biggest contracts of his career. There are a few scores he has left to settle in the meantime and God help anyone standing in his way.</content>

    <title>Novocaine + alcohol = one bolloxed bint</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned something today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me back up a bit.&lt;br/&gt;
So if you recall, yesterday i got my teeth fixed, which required about 5 shots of Novocaine.  &lt;br/&gt;
You&#8217;d think that six hours would be plenty of time for the effects to wear off and you could safely have a drink or two at the pub after work&#8230;&lt;br/&gt;
Well, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; could, probably.&lt;br/&gt;
But i had forgotten the golden rule of Selkies:  we have fuck-all tolerance for mixing any kind of drug with any kind of alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;
None. At. All.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, The Friend (i really have to find another way to refer to him - which will give him a grand-total of THREE noms de guerre in this journal, unless i drop The Friend, which i will do starting now.  Now he shall be known as Inuk.) &lt;br/&gt;
Anyway, Inuk and i were having a drink and flirting outrageously (but subtly, at least we seem to think so).  &lt;br/&gt;
I was In A Mood, because after the dentist, my day took a bit of a nose-dive;  i had to call California&#8217;s Vital Records Dept. AGAIN to see if Jamie&#8217;s death certificate is available yet (since his death was under investigation, it&#8217;s taking a while.  Obviously, this whole process is difficult for me, and i had my boss over my shoulder shooting questions and trying to be helpful, but really just made me feel like i was going to lose my mind).  &lt;br/&gt;
So by the time i hit the Pub, i was ready to cry/kick someone in the teeth.  &lt;br/&gt;
So Inuk and i talked, or rather i vented and he listened; i got it all off my chest and was able to relax and enjoy my wine.  &lt;br/&gt;
Since i have a Pavlovian response to Inuk (a combination of his ability to just listen to me,  kindly, then do something to make me feel better like make a sick joke or sling his huge arm around my shoulder and whisper something hilariously insulting mixed with the fact that he&#8217;s built like an Ox and could break me in two, but won&#8217;t), by the time i&#8217;d finished my first glass and was calm again, i was ready to drag him into the back room and gnaw on his clavicle.&lt;br/&gt;
I made some vulgar crack about needing to test out the viability of my new, chip-free teeth on various parts of his anatomy, which sort of sent us into this downward spiral of raunchiness and side-comments geared to make the other one flush with embarrassment and/or wildly frustrated, while at the same time keeping our voices low enough so that no one else around us can actually hear.&lt;br/&gt;
Well, since The Devil was one of those people, Irish Car Bombs quickly became part of the equation.&lt;br/&gt;
On a good day, one of those is enough to make me quite happy indeed.  Poured on top of Novocaine, i was done for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it was time for Inuk to walk me home, i was fully in &#8220;You&#8217;d Better Molest Me On The Way Or I&#8217;ll Kill You&#8221; mode.&lt;br/&gt;
Apparently, though, he and the Devil had plans to meet our friend S. at a pub a few blocks away.  Since i had to work the next morning, i had no intentions of going along, but apparently (and i say &#8220;apparently&#8221; because i have absolutely no recollection of this), i was a bit &lt;i&gt;displeased&lt;/i&gt; with this arrangement, as it thwarted my plans.  &lt;br/&gt;
Not in any serious kind of way, but i was like, &#8220;GRRRRRR&#8221;&#8230;but on the inside. &lt;br/&gt;
On the OUTSIDE, i&#8217;m all cool and collected and dealing with this in a Dignified Yet Sexy Manner.&lt;br/&gt;
Or so i think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me, dignified &amp; sexy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkie/5148074469/" title="dignified by selkie, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5148074469_692d9e7081.jpg" width="351" height="265" alt="dignified" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me, Drunk (a dramatization)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVimvNDcdk5A4-SGNyGPA3RxZz1mJ9eSl6TE8lRT4g0CXfZ24&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__f63WaYhsDYsA8GEVzwnPippp_-o="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look carefully, you will note some subtle yet very important differences.  &lt;br/&gt;
Last night, the difference is that i sort of stumbled up the stairs and told Inuk to &#8220;Go Fuck Yourself&#8221; while laughing like a howler-monkey on crack,  in response to his &#8220;Good Night, Selk!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, most men - &lt;i&gt;sane&lt;/i&gt; men, would be mortified and/or totally turned off.  And the next morning, when said Sane Man was asked by Female Howler-Monkey on Crack why she was &#8220;sort of but not actually mad at you&#8230;?&#8221;, the Sane Man would be all;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sod off, you crazed gutterslut!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not Inuk. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; takes me aside as he&#8217;s prepping the pub for coffee and such and says;&lt;br/&gt;
&#8220;Erhm.  The reason you were &#8216;mad&#8217; was because i was to molest you as severely as possible between here and home, and The Devil was sort of in the way&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oh my God.  I am SO SORRY&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No, no - it&#8217;s fine - it&#8217;s actually the first time i&#8217;ve ever been flattered by someone being upset with me!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8230;Oh. Well then&#8230;later, perhaps?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we proceeded, after i left to put Piglet down for a nap, to exchange some of the most sexually explicit/wildly frustrating texts known to man.  Or woman, for that matter.&lt;br/&gt;
Lemurs, even.  &lt;br/&gt;
Rutting boars have got nothing on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i get off work in 15 minutes - which means i get to flaunt myself in front of him while he finishes his shift at the Pub.&lt;br/&gt;
And because i now resemble the top picture much more than the other one,  i expect him to fully take out his frustrations on me in the most vulgar manner possible. &lt;br/&gt;
Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS - Oh, and what did i learn?  That, while mixing booze and Novocaine makes me look/act like photograph number two, apparently if you chose a crazy enough guy, it doesn&#8217;t really matter&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
