    <title>Untitled</title>
    <content type="html">I have fallen for you, violently. It only seems fair to let you know, fair to let you prepare, though it might be obvious. To me, it feels so obvious. A meeting between your being and mine feels correct in a way that makes my soul sigh, and I know I can't help it because your good vibrations reverberate my core, somehow I always fall so quickly. I hope it never seems insincere. I can tell you might not believe, I might not believe me in your place, I know, I have a hard time sometimes believing you, that you're falling too. I have a hard time sometimes believing in myself because sometimes, sometimes it's so dark in here it's hard to see what you see, but you see me even when we're just blind hands fumbling each other in the dark. I'm always fumbling. Sometimes I worry that my edges are too sharp. That this world has cast the stone that finally shattered my bruised pride, mind, heart. But I can believe in the you that believes in me. I speak the words that I believe in me into my heart, over and over a mantra of waves crashing against my souls stagnation, fear of the start. That bitter salt sea doesn't often taste true but your lips hold a spring that is fresh, and sweet, and deep; if I drink enough from your lips do you think I can wash this salt crust sea brine self doubt out of me? No, that's not how people work, I know, I've never been the type to believe in a savior. This is not a prayer for Redemption. I know no one can save me but me but maybe this is a start, another step in the process of becoming a part instead of apart. I know, sometimes, I get so silent it can be hard to see me there, but the quiet choking my throat is the pearl my heart built around whatever little sand grain made it scared. If ever I've loved you, I am sorry. I am sorry for the terror that keeps me apart because I would love nothing more than to be a part of something with you, something encompassing, something larger than you and me and we, a sum much larger than the sum of our parts. I've spent so long just trying to break out, and every pearl fractures, every step forward releases another hundred thousand grains of sand onto this desert, salt parched throat. And I'm wondering about feelings that have been felt by a hundred thousand others a hundred thousand times before, and the nature of authenticity, and if this, if these feelings, if it's not unique to me, does the story still bear repeating? Not a special snowflake, just another piece of humanity struggling with how or if to tell you about the grief inside my bones, the mania that makes my mind race, the anxious bird that beats itself against my inner ribcage trapped by the pearls piling into precarious mountains overhead. This doesn't end with an answer, there is no resolution. Just a quiet me, looking at you. </content>

    <title>Say Something</title>
    <content type="html">I spent years buried beneath the chokeweed chasers &lt;br/&gt;
drowning where the Ortho began to gather &lt;br/&gt;
in pools of where the lush green dropped &lt;br/&gt;
barren became the ground around the wellspring&lt;br/&gt;
droughted up, so I covered up&lt;br/&gt;
in jade green wondering at the sickened wasteland&lt;br/&gt;
in which we wander, wondering at how all the new&lt;br/&gt;
shiny perfection was just amalgam boiled horse&lt;br/&gt;
glue and chipped wooden forest extinction &lt;br/&gt;
to build hollow core doors, furniture that melts&lt;br/&gt;
like Dali's paint, no substance to stand in the progression&lt;br/&gt;
of time. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And I wonder if I am jaded green hollow cored &lt;br/&gt;
and empty, if I have dug out while scouring &lt;br/&gt;
the chokeweed, while looking for lost words, the essence--&lt;br/&gt;
what caused them to be in the first place, progenitor in absence&lt;br/&gt;
so I reach for what feels solid, brick, lathe, mortar and oak &lt;br/&gt;
because somewhere I gave away the whisperings of hope</content>

I was incandescent, argent pansophy &lt;br/&gt;
&#233;lan-dipped words draped honeyed tongue--&lt;br/&gt;
and here&lt;br/&gt;
where hulking, silent boulders of foundation &lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Skips a beat.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My body has been doing scary things to me lately. I feel like I am going to die.&lt;br/&gt;
My heart especially is frightening me. It has skipped beats, so that I feel like I am losing oxygen. I'm not certain, but I think this has been waking me up lately, just as I try to fall asleep. And sometimes, when I am just sitting on the couch, doing nothing, my heart is hammering in my chest.&lt;br/&gt;
It's not just my heart, though. I've got random pains in my back and side every other month or so. I have no idea what's causing them, except maybe inactivity. I am a lazy fatass, after all. (Yes. I can hear you out there screaming, "Don't let society's standards of beauty determine how you feel about your body!" But seriously. I'm at least 30 pounds overweight, if not 50. And I'm sure it's mostly fat, because I have so little strength). I also get winded at the oddest times.&lt;br/&gt;
I know I should do something, anything. Go to a doctor, especially. But I'm afraid to go to the doctor because I don't want to hear that I'm dying. I'm less than 30 years old (and I don't even feel as old as my age, except for all of these odd medical complaints. Mentally, I think I'm still about 17). I should not be having heart issues. I know it's damn foolish to stick my head in the sand like a proverbial ostrich. I should really be acting like a real-life ostrich and stand up and fight for my life. But then... I've often felt as if my life is not worth living, at least the way I'm living it now. I've never been able to see a future for myself. Maybe I don't have a future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Losing myself</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as punishment for starting to feel normal, like a real person, I keep experiencing these episodes of - I can't even explain it properly. My body feels like it's being pulled apart at the bones, these extreme feeling of -myself-  being pulled out my body. It lasts for hours, is accompanied by panic- not anything like a normal panic attack, but if the idea that if I can't keep myself in my body, I'll land in a psych hospital for eternity, that "they" are just waiting for it to happen, to take me away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk to myself out loud, to remind myself what's real and what isn't, and when the feeling goes away it's followed by headache and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's never happened before, and then in the last week its  happened three times. Part of me knows I should tell my shrink, but that irrational voice comes back and makes me scared that I would be committed against my will again. I tried to explain it to my husband the first time it happened, because it was so strange and I didn't know what to do. But he doesn't really understand- he's experienced depression, he's experienced anxiety...but never a psychotic break, he doesn't know what it's like, or the fear of it happening again. How do you explain that to someone, especially when they really aren't interested in understanding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm just scared. It happened again today, and I left the house, went driving- not the best idea, I know better than to drive during a panic attack of any sort, but I didn't think I could hold myself together staying in the house.  Driving here is weird, the towns are too close, there's no chance to go driving into the country side, it just doesn't exist. There's no way to get away from people and ground oneself, which I think is what I wanted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's lingering. I can still feel the pull in my arms, my hands, my skull.  I should be composing an email to my shrink, not writing in anonymous forum.&lt;/p&gt; </content>

    <title>Foggiest</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I lost myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happened in the past, I had an inkling of where to look.  Some bread-bit trail to follow that typically ended in someone else's bed.  Someone that didn't mind the crumbs.  I devoured and was devoured.  And that was okay, really.  For the time.  I needed the society, the sexuality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I'm running on empty.  There are no pieces to pick up.  There's nothing to fill me.  And I'm impossibly alone in a place that feels like it needs no one at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe I misspoke.  I haven't lost myself, but I've lost my sense of situation.  I don't belong with anyone, and I'm worried that maybe I don't belong with me, either.&lt;/p&gt;   </content>

    <title>Snapping</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I'd like to sabotage my boyfriend's food. Not poison him, or anything crazy like that. Just... overcook the meat, or oversalt it, or add a shit ton of mayonnaise to it (he hates mayo), or cook a bunch of meals with tofu (I don't like tofu, but I'd tolerate it.) Then maybe he'd stop treating me like I were some sort of goddamn live-in maid, and cook some of the food sometimes. Or maybe just cook his own damn food, for once.&lt;br/&gt;
I'm tired of being taken for granted, and I'm tired of having to be perfectly nice all the goddamn time. I don't like snapping at him, I really don't, but does he have to act like I'm personally offending him? My life is stressful, and I hate where I am and the inertia of my life and the stagnation of my goals. I hate myself most of the time. Yes, I should not take any of this out on the person I love. But... I'm tired of putting on a front. My mother thinks she raised two well-adjusted children. Well, I think she might have raised 1 well-adjusted child, because she has two children who are half as well adjusted as they should be. We're just both pretty good at pretending.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Untitled</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't fucking care if anyone thinks this is too depressing, because it's the truth. At least, it's the truth as of this moment, as a culmination of the emotional wreck I've been all week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would kill myself if I weren't an atheist. My existence is utterly pointless and meaningless, but the void of death is much more frightening to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aubade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;by Philip Larkin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.   &lt;br/&gt;
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.   &lt;br/&gt;
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.   &lt;br/&gt;
Till then I see what&#8217;s really always there:   &lt;br/&gt;
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,   &lt;br/&gt;
Making all thought impossible but how   &lt;br/&gt;
And where and when I shall myself die.   &lt;br/&gt;
Arid interrogation: yet the dread&lt;br/&gt;
Of dying, and being dead,&lt;br/&gt;
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse   &lt;br/&gt;
&#8212;The good not done, the love not given, time   &lt;br/&gt;
Torn off unused&#8212;nor wretchedly because   &lt;br/&gt;
An only life can take so long to climb&lt;br/&gt;
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;   &lt;br/&gt;
But at the total emptiness for ever,&lt;br/&gt;
The sure extinction that we travel to&lt;br/&gt;
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,   &lt;br/&gt;
Not to be anywhere,&lt;br/&gt;
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a special way of being afraid&lt;br/&gt;
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,&lt;br/&gt;
That vast moth-eaten musical brocade&lt;br/&gt;
Created to pretend we never die,&lt;br/&gt;
And specious stuff that says No rational being&lt;br/&gt;
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing&lt;br/&gt;
That this is what we fear&#8212;no sight, no sound,   &lt;br/&gt;
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,   &lt;br/&gt;
Nothing to love or link with,&lt;br/&gt;
The anaesthetic from which none come round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it stays just on the edge of vision,   &lt;br/&gt;
A small unfocused blur, a standing chill   &lt;br/&gt;
That slows each impulse down to indecision.   &lt;br/&gt;
Most things may never happen: this one will,   &lt;br/&gt;
And realisation of it rages out&lt;br/&gt;
In furnace-fear when we are caught without   &lt;br/&gt;
People or drink. Courage is no good:&lt;br/&gt;
It means not scaring others. Being brave   &lt;br/&gt;
Lets no one off the grave.&lt;br/&gt;
Death is no different whined at than withstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   &lt;br/&gt;
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   &lt;br/&gt;
Have always known, know that we can&#8217;t escape,   &lt;br/&gt;
Yet can&#8217;t accept. One side will have to go.&lt;br/&gt;
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   &lt;br/&gt;
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring&lt;br/&gt;
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.&lt;br/&gt;
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.&lt;br/&gt;
Work has to be done.&lt;br/&gt;
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>No.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I deleted my journal. I am spread so thin, between so many pages, my fingers weighed with multiple pens. All the same exact color and brand. I wonder what that says about my personality. Doesn't much matter, because I drifted with purpose (minimize outside distractions. It's not working as well as I intended, goddamnit tumblr). I debated this post in my head today, back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to say something now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have to justify myself, my writing, or my misery, to you OR anyone else. Got it? In the safe headspace I create for myself, you are not welcome. I'm glad you want to be patted on the back for how deeply you've delved into your personal misery, but guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You. Are. Not. Me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't get to pick and choose for me. No one does, unless I give them that power. I don't have to justify my emotions, my words, my life - NONE OF IT - to you. If you don't find my adult conversation scintillating, perhaps &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should find another group of adults to pick apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the thing that gets me. Instead of a petty attempt at cruelty (which is only cruel in that it could possibly trigger others, otherwise it screams of "pay me attention because I'm hurting and I can't capture anyone else's attention"), digging and chipping at others, why don't &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; find what you are so obviously searching for? It's not here. And we won't change to fit what YOU want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry that I'm not sorry at all; this needed to be said. If anyone needs to grow up, it's you. This place doesn't fit you anymore? Quit pointing fingers at those you think need to change to fit your needs and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOVE ON.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone else: I know, I fed the troll. The thing is, depression is not a set of glasses that I can take on and off, as much as I wish it were. I can't control the black hole that consumes me for months at a time. Writing is a form of therapy. No one should feel condemned because of words they were brave enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't stop sharing. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;but I believe in peace,&lt;br/&gt;
oh, I believe in peace, bitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>we gnash until our tears grow old</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Like a physical malady, I can't stop shaking. A physical stutter, more like; the clenching of sternum and throat, a half-hearted grasping that ends as it begins since I know the intangible goal won't be attained. Probably I look fucking retarded.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Why can't I like normal people," I wonder silently, hating myself for wishing I could, proud that I hate myself for it, seizing as my body starts and stops the struggle to win against -- what, exactly?&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Breathe.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Breathe in. Breathe out.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I know something's wrong, that this is not how things ought be. Everywhere, in every story, in every life, even the most inept are constantly overcoming, set back by no hurdle, obstacle, or misfortune. Beggars can be choosers of their street corner. Where is my mind?&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The tears cease, and can be admitted. The shakes are too slow, they can be stifled, hugged in the flexion of normativity, invulnerability. The tension sprawls, stretching out behind the driver, in the back of your mind, the gaze felt, dynamic, wrestling silently for control.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Veer into obtruse texts and the feely Facebook posting. Ride the rail of a close friend's patience. Let the wheel go, embrace Project Mayhem, and know that dying is only a culmination of each singular desire failing, one by one, until all that's left is a vehicle comprised of hesitation choices and the tries for things beyond your means.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Lovesong II</title>
    <content type="html">Do you think that I put on sometimes I watch my hand shake&lt;br/&gt;
it quakes over a bowl of milk and eggs sometimes this inner tremble&lt;br/&gt;
becomes more lease than I'd afford. Washed over because the tide turns&lt;br/&gt;
unrelentless undertow in any act of days where I cannot take the stage&lt;br/&gt;
creep to an exit of stage left or stage right in hopes &lt;br/&gt;
that I am still closer to a yes than gone. Sometimes I can&lt;br/&gt;
I sit in greened sunshine with cookies books and we to watch &lt;br/&gt;
Sunday slip by sometimes, sometimes I cannot see&lt;br/&gt;
where this is going--do I dare to eat a peach? I sometimes slip&lt;br/&gt;
from my knowing, each to each. Sometimes I just breathe danger&lt;br/&gt;
when there's echoing and sound sometimes I cannot listen &lt;br/&gt;
when the world rushes in and drown. Will there be time, will there be&lt;br/&gt;
time for when I am out from under, time for tea and cakes&lt;br/&gt;
or moments past their crisis. I grow old I grow numb--&lt;br/&gt;
I have seen the triumph of my mind undone in little worlds&lt;br/&gt;
that separate the you from me in every thoughtless count&lt;br/&gt;
and recount of the unkept tally. Is there debt for what was done&lt;br/&gt;
or should you write off anything from minds who can only run?</content>

    <title>anxiety</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;"i can't come tonight after all," you say. "i have anxiety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel like i've been kicked in the knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;you're leaving me with him,&lt;/i&gt; is all i can think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you ask me if i'm angry with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"no," i say, as anxieties of my own start blooming in my gut. i fight to keep the tears back. he's on his way now. he can't see me cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"then what's the problem?" you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i try to explain to you about him. but you fall silent, and i can't keep the sobs back anymore. you're gone, and i consider hiding myself for the rest of the night the way you do, so nobody will see me. but instead i wipe my face, get myself some water, button up my feelings, and crawl into his backseat. my nose runs for the entirety of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Only once gets through, then gets scattered by the rain.</title>
    <content type="html">Sometimes I have a tremendous sensation that I'm doing it all wrong, usually at times where I notice how I'm simply throwing myself at the terrible glass wall of my anxiety in attempts to do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. I flail and splash in silence, drowning as the spring of potential wells up beneath me, overflowing until all I can do is scrabble, hopelessly, against the cool, transparent border between inaction and creation, as unable to drown as break through. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There is more, there is more, there is a formless shape in the darkness inside of me trying to claw its way out of my chest&lt;/i&gt;--I could release it, but all my means, all my great works of life come up lacking in skill. We've been pressed with the bill, and the clerk has noted, simply, in a small script in the corner, insufficient funds. Without a means of creating our own release, we stumble on the words, trip over incomplete lines, skin knees on blotches of color and the sharp edge of the paper. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have the means, but the road is blocked, or lost within the tempest hurricane that swirls and strews refuse and debris across the path. A little dog with a dustpan brush face is sweeping away what led us so far into these woods. No breadcrumbs, no shining pebbles; then, going back was never an option. All that can happen is continuing on, because from the centre of what we are, the only place to move is out. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To that end, experience everything. To fight the winds we've traveled, we will outrun--is it a temporary solution? Is it escapism? A grandiose mistake? A step in the right direction, mayhaps a step towards... ? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Out. Outside, beyond the wall of winds, beyond the glass, there is a place where I will pour forth all the hot words that come now in fits and starts, short little bursts of truth that scant offer relief. I will resolve us into one. I have stepped out from the eye, the false calm of security into a thrust of unknown, terror, change; even if I return, nothing will be the same, the game has begun. What happens now will cause cracks, frigid pool of immobility to one side, the burning flood of &lt;i&gt;something more&lt;/i&gt; trying to press through will transform it into a torrent of Dutch tears, replete in tensile stress. Even this thick glass will shatter, and if I cannot stop the winds, I have become enough to stand up to the shrapnel of shards I will create. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm still in love with the idea of us.&lt;br/&gt;
I struggle to be in love with you though. I find it hard to see how I could ever fall for you, when you make it so damned hard. &lt;br/&gt;
But then sometimes I catch myself falling for you just a little bit, because of something you've done or something you've said. And sometimes I fall a little bit, when you've done nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt; </content>

    <title>Untitled</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm finding it hard to drum up any enthusiasm about anything these days. I'm probably depressed, but I think that's my natural state, anyway; I just have less going on in my life to distract from it. Well, I suppose that's not true. I have plenty going on, but none of it is particularly good. To wit:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have had a literal slew of rejections for finding archaeology jobs this spring. In fact, I have only had one phone interview related to archaeology, and since one my fellow interns posted today on Facebook about getting a job at this same place, though a different duty station, and the job is supposed to start either May 20 or May 28, I'm not holding my breath that I'll get that. On top of that, I've applied to Park Service and Forest Service positions at the level I'm supposedly qualified for, and I keep not getting referred to the selecting officials. There has been maybe 3 or 4 positions where I have been, and not a single interview has come out of them. It's very frustrating. I wish I knew what was wrong with my application, or what's lacking in my experience. But of course, the feedback in this process is pretty much nil.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from some temp positions that turned out very temp indeed (they were test scoring positions, and I either failed the qualifying exams by not being accurate enough, or later got disqualified by not continuing to be accurate -- which of course, makes me feel like a moron), I have not had any work since I left the Forest Service internship at the end of last August. I'm about 11 months from when I started that position, and... well, I feel like a failure. I have tried like crazy to find any sort of work, whether archaeology or no. The last couple of months as the field season has started, I've put most of my energy into finding an archaeology position, but in the winter, I was looking at anything from office work to working in a warehouse doing seasonal work there. Nothing. It's demoralizing, and it's only getting worse as the days, weeks, months drag on, because I feel like such a failure, and my resume is reflecting that failure with an ever-widening chasm of unemployment. I've pretty much given myself (and my boyfriend BH; as our financial futures are pretty much entwined at this point) a deadline of the end of June to find an archaeology-related job. If I've found nothing, I have to start looking at something else, and I don't just mean until next field season -- I mean it's back to the drawing board. The problem is, I've got some ideas but no idea how to achieve them -- and, as I said above, I'm not feeling much enthusiasm for much in my life these days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worse than all of this, though, was the news that we got about a month ago. BH's dad has been diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. It hasn't spread very far, and it's of a certain type that is now very treatable with newer drugs, but it's still spread, and it's still one of the scarier cancers out there. All I can hope is that it goes well, but we've both got that hanging over our heads, and it's been very stressful as we've been waiting for news from thousands of miles away&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While very minor in comparison, I've been dealing with my own health problems the last few weeks. It started off with some pretty excruciating back pain, that also extended into the upper right abdomen. I started to get better, but a couple of weekends ago after a busy day out, I went to bed late on Saturday night. I'd been having a lot of trouble with the pain while lying down, and that night it was really bad, and I moved wrong, felt a pop, and the pain increased. That scared me enough to go to the emergency room (though urgent care would have been preferable if it had been earlier in the day when they were open), and long story short, they took some X-rays, diagnosed me with a chest wall strain, gave me some pain pills and muscle relaxers, and sent me on my not-so-merry way. I thought it was basically the end of it, but a few days after, the ER doc called me and said they'd looked at the X-rays again and saw possible fluid in the lung, and recommended a CT scan. So, freaking out, I made an appointment with a doctor to get that referral. I got a CT scan, and I'm still waiting for the results, scared as hell. I keep telling myself (and BH keeps telling me) that it's probably nothing, but still, I'm freaked out and counting the days until Thursday, when my follow-up appointment is. On top of all of this, my insurance is not the greatest because I'm self-insured, so I'm sure I'm looking at least a couple of grand out of pocket because of a deductible that has to be taken care of first. So I'm freaking out about money and my health, and someone else's health. And I'm still in some pain, though it has gotten a lot better since my ER visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, life feels pretty bleak. My career is pretty well stillborn, my health is crap, my boyfriend's dad is in even worse health, and I am a financial failure and about to get lower. I sure as hell hope this is the nadir, because I don't think I could handle it if it gets any worse than this.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Like a hurricane. </title>
    <content type="html">In a small way, I was afraid of why you'd come. So much of life is wrapped in expectation, so much that effort is kept minimal unless &lt;i&gt;something else&lt;/i&gt; is to be gained. Lassitude laced into the fabric of our lives, where action is saved for selfish intention. You didn't come to dash to bits the sea wall, roll a gale over it, forced summer storm while I washed out to sea. In a way maybe I was trying to see if I would break, or maybe I wanted to break someone against me. In spite of that, I kept burning the lighthouse. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Something else was gained in the calm that swept the water, something else spoke in the crash of waves on the beach. Something more, because it was less. What I lit was not doused, did not flicker in the startling calm of the air. Yet it stirred. I felt the flame grow hungry, and hot, and strangely content. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These words feel clumsy, feel small and misplaced; gone the confidence of craft, the swift skill of smithy. They drop, syllable by syllable, heavy and intentioned into the cool, white space; spend hours swirling between realization and the dark corners of contemplation. They cling to the hem, hide behind skirts, shrink in the face of open appraisal. To speak a thing it to make it real, to write grants power--these words tremble in the act of realization because even now they are unsure of themselves. Pause. Write. Pause. &lt;br/&gt;

    <title>An Abrupt Departure</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At times, you must wonder if it is enough. The rote. Perfunctory kisses on foreheads and the occasional straddled thigh: we become more of our parents than we realize, than we expect. Roll off to your side of the bed now, begin the snore sequence. Same low ceilings, stolen blankets, wide eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say our love is different, but is it different enough? Can it sustain the night? Will it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, my doubting heart. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
