    <title>Performing again</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In life outside of work, Camille, and Cerys, I wrote three new poems last weekend ahead of my monthly open mike poetry night. I haven&#8217;t written anything in a while, and didn&#8217;t really know if I had any ideas until I sat down and started writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explained my creative process to the others in my writing group as feeling like I&#8217;m lightning rod &#8212; I conduct the words onto the page, from somewhere I don&#8217;t know where, rather than feeling like I am creating them. I wrote a poem about the nightmares I had as a child of being carried away by a black bird (the subject of a painting I produced several years ago), a poem about last month&#8217;s meteor over Russia, and a poem about desire that without saying so was about self harm, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others in my writing group came along to the open mike, and a couple also performed &#8212; it was good, since I so rarely can have anyone come along to support me on the night. Unexpectedly, a girl I was at school with &#8212; but haven&#8217;t seen since I was 18 &#8212; came into London just for the occasion. We&#8217;re Facebook friends, and I&#8217;d invited her, but I invite a lot of people and nearly everyone just ignores it &#8212; so I didn&#8217;t expect to see her. It was nice to see her and interesting to spend time with her. And before it looks like I&#8217;m suggesting romantic interest: she&#8217;s gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked what I wrote, and I liked how I performed &#8212; then we stayed out drinking far too late and I missed the last train home, but it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was a wholly different open mike night, and this time Camille was performing. Camille is in a show choir, and so her and some of her fellow choir friends went along to practice some songs they are working on. It was a very different sort of night to what I am used to in Shoreditch, this had a range of ages and people, and being a night based more on music had people performing Noel Coward songs and piano pieces as well as reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up to read myself, but wasn&#8217;t sure what to perform myself. When it came to music, it seemed that most people performed covers &#8212; so I wondered if it was appropriate to read poems that weren&#8217;t my own. I was reassured by a writer friend it would be OK, and she suggested a combination &#8212; with reading one of my own, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I read Pablo Neruda&#8217;s &#8220;Tonight I Can Write&#8221; (and if I say so myself, I think I read it well &#8212; because I know the poem well and have read it aloud many times, though never to a group of people) and carefully selected to read my new poem &#8220;The Great Black Bird&#8221;, since it didn&#8217;t reveal or hint at anything Camille wasn&#8217;t aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t know if I would attend again, the first half of the night was entirely dedicated to the host singing &#8212; and I didn&#8217;t much like the songs or his style &#8212; but enjoyed the open mike portion. I do wish I could get more people to come and see me perform, but part of my style is so many &#8220;things I&#8217;ll never say&#8221; and can&#8217;t be shared with Camille or anyone close to her.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I just want to be alive</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It turns out, my work&#8217;s attitude towards my relationship with Cerys was only going to be the tip of the iceberg. When I returned from Berlin and my boss had seemed mean and grumpy and given me a hard time about things, including Cerys, that was just the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;d told my boss and selected colleagues about my anxiety and depression in the hope they&#8217;d get it and get me better, offer me help where I needed it, be more understanding. On Monday I went into my normal Skype meeting with my boss and instead of the usual catch up, I got stuck with a Personal Improvement Plan and told that x, y, and z were wrong with my work, and I had to meet certain goals, or face losing my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, guys! That is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; how you should treat an employee who tells you they have problems with anxiety and depression: give them something to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; worry about! I knew the two events were unrelated &#8212; a document like this had to be at least a week in the making, before I told them I had problems &#8212; but it should have been handled more compassionately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was nearly two weeks ago now, and I am firmly back on my medication with a promise to myself to not stop taking it like that again. I might be sad and a little anxious most of the time, but I can put a mask on it now, I can cope, I can enjoy myself. Without it, my moods overwhelm me. Though as an interesting side note, I&#8217;m aware that my medication (Citalopram, if you are interested) is used to treat anxiety. It&#8217;s interesting because anxiety is also a side effect of the medication, and clearly why my anxiety seems worse now I&#8217;m tackling my depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other side effects include diarrhoea (which once led me to having to practically run out of a Group Cycle class), sexual dysfunction (I was already dysfunctional, so this isn&#8217;t great: look up &#8216;retarded ejaculation&#8217; if you&#8217;re interested), distraction, yawning, flatulence and possibly mania. If you&#8217;d seen how far down I went when I stopped taking the medication, you&#8217;ll understand why these side effects are worth taking the medication for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things at work have slightly improved. Cerys and I behave professionally in the office, but if we get a chance to be alone together we will still embrace and I&#8217;ll still kiss her. Part of me likes that it&#8217;s now almost clandestine , Cerys gets playfully annoyed at me when I make it sound sordid. I&#8217;m working on my improvement plan and making reasonable progress towards my goals. I produced on target the business plan I was tasked with, and my boss had no criticisms of it. I have to work on my communication and presentation skills, still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with HR and took them through my Plan line by line, outlining what I felt was unfair, untrue, inaccurate or ambiguous in it. How my boss will react when HR take this back to her, I don&#8217;t know, but Camille encouraged me not to take it lying down and not be seen as a soft target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, though, my thoughts have been returning to the idea that I don&#8217;t want to spend my life in marketing. A friend shared with a story from Men&#8217;s Fitness magazine, about 10 adventures you can have that beat the traditional vacation &#8212; like whale watching for conservation, measuring volcanic activity, tracking animals and Mayan artefacts, that sort of stuff. The trouble is I don&#8217;t want a vacation: I want these things to be my life. Right now, I am working myself to the bone just to make money for someone else and for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll never tell anyone this, but I was disappointed.  There was a larger part of me than I would ever admit to myself, that I would ever say aloud, that wanted the test to be positive.  Even if the rest of me knew and sighed with relief when it was negative, it felt like my heart was breaking again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s scary, knowing now that I really do want that again.&lt;/p&gt; </content>

    <title>Office relations guide: how to avoid being a sex pest in the workplace </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/office-relations-guide-how-to-avoid-being-a-sex-pest-in-the-workplace-8517375.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; linked, and wondered if it would be a joke piece. It isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s serious, but it has also got me wondering about one of the things I mentioned in my &lt;a href="http://stillwater.codexed.com/2013/03/02/the-next-thing-you-know"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Scenario 1: &#8220;I am a single man and fancy one of my colleagues, who is younger than and junior to me. Is there an &#8216;appropriate&#8217; way I can take our friendship to a sexual level?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, no. Sorry&#8230; As Sarah Culshaw, a partner in the employment team at Collyer Bristow Solicitors, can attest, it&#8217;s not how you get into it that matters, it&#8217;s how you get out.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve had several cases where I&#8217;ve been acting for individuals where it&#8217;s gone wrong and the junior person is then complaining and there&#8217;s enough evidence that makes it look as though it was part of a harassment scenario.&#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am wondering whether the instruction to be less &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; with Cerys isn&#8217;t because anyone finds it offensive or inappropriate, but because the company is concerned that if our relationship should &#8220;go wrong&#8221; somewhere along the way, it could become very difficult for the company, and for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this might not be the case at all &#8212; it really might be that it is considered unprofessional for us to be so affectionate in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The next thing you know</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stopped taking my medication recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for the usual reasons medical professionals see, where the patient says &#8220;I feel better! I don&#8217;t need this any more!&#8221; but because I still felt miserable and had constant thoughts of hurting myself. I saw no point in taking the medication if I still felt like shit, so I started skipping two out of three meals a day, and stopped taking my medication, and decided I didn&#8217;t want to feel better and would just rather self destruct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the last week in Berlin, and maybe part of the city &#8212; along with the grey skies and cold air &#8212; affected my thoughts and my mood. It didn&#8217;t help I was stressed trying to manage a large conference for work, and my colleagues were being more complaining than complimentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned on Thursday, I went straight from the airport to the office. I was due to have a call with my boss in New York at the end of the day, and it made more sense to have it the office to get to my writing group in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call wasn&#8217;t what I was expected, where we normally catch up and chat about what I&#8217;m working on, what I need help with and what&#8217;s on my mind, this meeting seemed more to be a bollocking. My colleagues had reported I seemed out of my depth at the conference, and had complained about various things &#8212; even though the conference had more than 250 (mostly happy) people, and great speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also unexpectedly taken to task about my relationship with Cerys. It felt like almost a formal warning &#8212; our relationship was not appropriate and unprofessional for the workplace, we are &#8212; and I quote &#8212; &#8220;too touchy-feely&#8221;. I am 99% sure it was our colleague the marketing director who must have complained to my boss, since when I walked into the office, Cerys practically ran across the room to meet me, and embraced me in a big hug. I hugged her back hard, kissed her on the top of the head and told her it was good to see her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we hug and touch and kiss in the office &#8212; but it&#8217;s not like we are a couple, so we don&#8217;t behave like one, if I kiss her it&#8217;s not on the lips or in a romantic way, we certainly don&#8217;t spend our time making out or worse. It made me very angry, and Cerys understands how I feel. I was especially angry that nobody would have said something quietly to me without going to my manager &#8212; who is the community director &#8212; behind my back and making it seem like an issue. But I have obliged by moving the storage box from under my desk to form a physical barrier between Cerys and me, and am trying to move things along my desk to force me to sit further away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems ridiculous to me that anyone should complain that I am too close or too friendly with a colleague &#8212; as I say, we are not sleeping together, we are not in a relationship and don&#8217;t behave like we are. Yes, we are close and very affectionate, but that&#8217;s also because we understand each other and as two people who suffer from depression, it is nice to have someone around who will hug you when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a decision, and contacted HR. Not about Cerys, of course &#8212; if that is considered an issue, there isn&#8217;t much I can say about it, except be quietly angry. But I told the global HR manager about my problems with depression, anxiety, my medication not helping like it&#8217;s supposed to, and how I can&#8217;t see a therapist because I can&#8217;t afford it. I asked him if I should tell my manager &#8212; and the colleagues I report to in whatever way. He replied, sympathetically and understandingly, and gently suggested he thought I should tell them. They can&#8217;t understand or help you if they don&#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Cerys the next morning, and she agreed. She thought it was brave, but also thought it would be a good idea. So I told them, in an email. My manager (the community director), the marketing director, and a colleague with whom I will apparently be meeting and sort of reporting to each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It terrified me to do it. I&#8217;ve resisted telling anyone in case they think &#8220;What use is a community manager who suffers from anxiety?&#8221; and fire me. But I know I am good at my job, and I want to be better at my job, and by being open about these parts of myself perhaps people will understand a bit better and support me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&#8217;t know really who to trust. I know I can trust the guy in HR, he told us when we joined we could talk to him about anything, any time, and he would listen and advise without it necessarily going down in our HR record. I know I can trust Cerys with these things about myself. But much more than that, I don&#8217;t know who can be trusted &#8212; I don&#8217;t know who will report things I tell them in confidence, I don&#8217;t know who might have something against me. I&#8217;ve had colleagues in the past that I was sure were working against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a blank &#8220;depression screening form&#8221; I found on my desk while trying to tidy it yesterday. I decided to fill it out, and was disturbed my own answers. There were far too many ticks in the fourth column. Admitting to colleagues I had a health problem suggested to me I want to be better and I don&#8217;t want to self destruct, so I have decided to start eating and taking my medication again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, because I have issues with trust, I might decide to password protect this journal. The password would be freely available to everyone and anyone on cdx, but I worry about others from the outside finding it. For now, I will keep it open &#8212; and monitor if I think unwanted visitors are reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was such a great start to the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping in was amazing as always. My gal and I slept past noon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we laid around. Didn't do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she gave me a random blow job. And it was phantasmagorical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. Phantasmagorical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, not really. That doesn't really make sense. But I like that word! I just wanted to use it so I forced it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Insert "That's what she said" here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I'm already sidetracked. Let's recap the last six sentences and one parenthesis wrapped sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great started to the weekend, slept in and it was amazing, laid around and didn't do anything, then got a GREAT random blow job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we fucked. A lot. For a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again... Great start to the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least until I went to brush my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the usual chain of events that comes with the brushing of the teeth ritual. I got my tooth brush out. Got the bristles wet to 'soften' them. Grabbed the tooth paste. Applied some to the bristles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's when it went awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some water from the faucet hit the paste covered tooth brush and somehow managed to rocket some toothpaste DIRECTLY INTO MY EYE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fucking eyeball was on fire. Which is a strange contrast to the cool mintiness of the paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of ruined the entire start of the day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">She shone godly that night; her palace branched out further than usual, marbling a more extensive section of the sky with silver-lit luminescent corridors, each containing wonders incomprehensible by mortal minds. It was a once in all-time occasion; she shared the sky with a cousin for eleven months, a cousin who shone nine times brighter than her, but no more or less beautifully. This night was the culmination of their amalgamation. All creation beheld, breath stood still, and perfection was realized if for only a moment in the fallacy labelled &#8216;time&#8217;. </content>

    <title>How can you be so impartial?</title>
    <content type="html">Bury it deep, this house has no foundation and there is nothing upon which these pillars could stand. They would topple, they would knock it all down, and your Ivory Tower is nothing more than a house made of cards, or smooth set of dominoes. Blank faced, no pips, thousands of tiles surrender in a musical clattering. Bury it deep, for you will upset the status quo. Three's company with no third wheel, and you shouldn't make something from nothing, least of all a denial. It's unexisting, you whisper to the void, you fall on ears deaf and dumb and unaware. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The problem is not knowing, you've let things settle, settled on the word busy and distractions and letting anything be enough, even when it isn't. Not quite. Not even if you'd like to be. Because you are unaware of where you're going, drifting but not cut loose. You let the silence reverberate through these hollow spaces, knock around and ricochet off the places that you've filled with other faces and words and events and it's not enough. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Except when it is. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This time you can't delay the conversation, this time you need to know. It's from unexpected places, but take your courage when and where you can find it. Swim, if you're done with floating, don't drown. </content>

Except that it was several years out of date and referred to people like Camille as a cute Aussie girl who had just moved to the UK, rather than my girlfriend of about 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s updated now, reflecting the current status of my friendships with people like Camille, Cecilia and Cerys &#8212; along with people whose names do not begin with a C.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some days, I feel so troubled I think I should seek professional help. I hate having to go back to therapy, I didn&#8217;t even like admitting I needed anti-depressants. But when you get to a point where you feel surrounded on all sides by troubles &#8212; stupid, trivial things, things that many people would dream of having as their troubles &#8212; and it&#8217;s hard to see a way out.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>About the one you love, and the one who loves you </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent this past 5 days in the company of Cerys. Which isn&#8217;t really a surprise, as I sit next to her all day at work every day normally. Except in Miami I must have run up a large telephone bill sending her text messages all the time. Surprisingly for her, she actually replied (I think) to nearly all of them. It&#8217;s something that pisses me off with her sometimes at home &#8212; the way she often just doesn&#8217;t respond to messages, and I feel like I have ceased to exist for her: out of sight, out of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this week has been spent in her company probably more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived into Miami about two hours later than planned, and was endearingly pleased to see me. I checked in at the hotel, went up to my room and was unpacking when Cerys arrived at my door (I had already texted her my room number). As soon as I opened the door she launched herself at me in a jump-tackle-hug. I gave her my spare room key right away, because that&#8217;s just the relationship we have: although I still locked the door at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was showered and changed, she took me to the carnival party that was that evening&#8217;s entertainment at my company meeting, and I spent the evening wandering around, talking warmly to colleagues I&#8217;d already met (some many times over the years, before I joined) and colleagues I&#8217;d talked to only online. Some clearly knew me better than I knew them as they would strike up a conversation and it would be several minutes before the context or their accent enlightened me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll write more about Miami another day, maybe. Today is for thoughts on Cerys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve said before how I have romantic feelings for her, although these wax and wane depending on the day or my mood. This week there were other guys looking at her like lost puppies, and at least one guy in particular that Cerys confessed to me she was in love with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Cerys falls in love, or how she describes it, isn&#8217;t nearly as confusing as it sounds when she is so besotted with her boyfriend. One night I was talking to Camille on Skype, and mentioned how Cerys had told me a mutual colleague wanted to know if he could join us for my birthday dinner that night &#8212; I had no illusions who it was that wanted him to join us. I told Camille about it, briefly, and we both laughed how Cerys had just a few minutes earlier posted on Facebook how much she was looking to go home and see her boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cerys explained it to me perhaps the next day, that she just can&#8217;t help but fall in love with people &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t mean she wants anything to happen. With Cerys herself firmly in the front of my mind, I told her sincerely that I knew exactly what she meant, of being in love with someone and wanting so badly for them to return your feelings, but also desperately wanting them not to so, because it would be bad and confusing. You long for someone and pine for them and live for their attention and feel cold and abandoned when you don&#8217;t get it and learn they love someone else, but at the same time this is exactly the way it has to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a little weird to see her sad to be leaving, and sad to be leaving the company of this guy she had fallen with, even though she was going home to the love of her life. And I thought about my relationship with her, how it will never be the same as that, and about Josephine, and about Camille, and about how the one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have to keep learning this same lesson, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Deafening Silence</title>
    <content type="html">Silence is different for me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Because I forgot what it sounds like.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The ringing in my left ear has grown in intensity over the last few years. My the hearing in my right is absolutely blown out no thanks to gunfire, mortars, and roadside bombs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now that I'm home, I notice it more. The city I used to live in would drown it out. Night or day, sirens and the clashing of the street just kept the noise at bay and I slept better. Even in Iraq, I could feel the constant hush of the desert breeze over my ears. There are no more loud and rowdy soldiers up at all times of night doing God-knows-what upstairs. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It just grows now. At first it whistles. Then it rises. Then it maintains a steady tone like the final line on a heart monitor. It fills my head and smothers the thoughts if I let it. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sometimes I'll do anything to stop it for a moment.&lt;br/&gt;
Whistle.&lt;br/&gt;
Move something.&lt;br/&gt;
Tap a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
Sing part of a song.&lt;br/&gt;
Even in public, I don't give a fuck. If I look crazy, then maybe it's because I am.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Other times, I close my eyes and will so hard for it to go away that I somehow even manage to take the constant screeching in my head down a few decibels.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anything to remind myself that I'm not in a war zone.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The worst part about the noise is I remember when it started. I opened my eyes and the dust was everywhere. Someone pulled me up and began screaming orders into my face. I saw big white teeth beneath a face half covered in blood and dust mouthing what looked to simply be,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Get the fuck up."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I blinked at him. The blast had left my brain rattled so hard that I hadn't really gotten a grasp that I was a man with a gun in a bad country. I forgot that it was job to use the gun. All I knew was that somebody's spittle was hitting my goggles and that goddamn ringing in my ears was going to make the rest of the day very hard.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The bloody man's big hand came up and slapped the side of my helmet so hard that it almost rocked my goggles off my face. He mouthed again what looked to be,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Hey, fucktard. Get the fuck up."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then it suddenly came pouring in. The hiss of air, the trembling rumble of HMMWV engines pulling in tight around me, pops and whizzes of bullets followed by cracks and jolts of gunfire. It was like when you leave the radio on way too fuckin' loud and forget about it the next time you get in your car. Sometimes I still hear my breath catching up to me. I can see that man screaming at me again, and by the time I can feel the trigger beneath my finger, I'm back on planet Earth. Just like that, as if someone turned on the light and the dream was unplugged.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Another guy got rocked so hard he got tossed a good 15 feet, only to land square on his back armor plate like a forlorn turtle when the bomb had gone off. Whoever planted it was an amateur and his or her lack of skill meant my hearing over my life. I wasn't the only deaf one either. Fair compromise,  I suppose.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I figure I'll be one of those old guys with the a funnel to put to my ear for hearing. That is, when I'm not carrying my walker around and pointing at the sky like an anti-aircraft gun screaming harmless things like, "THE JAPS ARE COMING." &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Nobody got hurt badly that day.&lt;br/&gt;
Funny saying that.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Hey, Dave, how was the war today?"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Great! Nobody died! Thanks for asking."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I just see that bloody face when the silence grows loud with the piercing ring in my head.&lt;br/&gt;
It's rather unpleasant.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Not working is driving me mad. MAD. MADD. With two D's!</content>
