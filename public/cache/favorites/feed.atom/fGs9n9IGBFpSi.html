    <title>Ahem...</title>
    <content type="html">From Scott:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fuck Trevor, let's move in to this house. (If you want). Do you wanna take a look at it tonight or tomorrow after work? We can rent it as soon as May 1st. That would give me all of May till June to move all my stuff. If we get it I'll tell my landlord that we're not signing a year lease. What do you think?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I like the back yard. :)&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Haters gonna hate</title>
    <content type="html">Rex came over last night after finishing stuff at the store. The first thing he did was sit down in my bed and pull me into his lap. He smooched me over and over again. When I told him he was being extremely cuddley all he said was, "I always like snugging you. I love it," and then nuzzled his face in my neck.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He was quiet for a while before he said anything else, which turned out to be possibly one of the most surprising things I've ever heard him say.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"The next person that tells me we're not right together I'm going to tell them to fuck off because it's just not true. I feel so normal with you, which is good. It's like I'm really myself."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He took me out of his lap at that point and filled me in on some details with his dad, who is currently in the hospital. Then he excused himself to phone him. Apparently there are some heart things going on. Now, his dad lives alone and Rex only sees him once a week (and sometimes he has to skip weeks). This is a choice mostly of his father's. Rex has offered to come by more often, would &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; to go more often, but his dad gets all old man stubborn and says, "I like my routine and the way things are."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But when Rex teared up, talking about how worried he is about his father and his obvious inability to recognize that he needs help my heart cried with him. I hugged him and listened to him talk. I tried to hold back all of the intellectualism that I normally insert in emotional situations like that- something that has always irritated him. I held his hand and kissed his forehead. It was eye opening. He has never been that emotional in front of me. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When he calmed down he said he wanted to have a shower, so we did. And here again we insert another thing I never thought I'd hear him say. "It's different this time. I honestly believe all of that stuff is never going to happen again. I feel completely different, like there is no doubt whatsoever. I'll stay as long as you will." I kissed him and we helped each other scrub down and get clean.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We hopped into bed after and watched an episode of Top Chef, something neither of us had done in each other's absence. It was almost one by the time we shut the TV off and rolled over to go to bed. There's some other conversation/events that went on here that I may share in a different (protected) entry, but when we finally did get to sleep it was with fingers entwined, matched measured breaths and loving hearts. </content>
