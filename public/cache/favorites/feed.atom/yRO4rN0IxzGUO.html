    <title>If Poe Were an Elementary Librarian</title>
    <content type="html">(After &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/237388"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Take this book into your arm!&lt;br/&gt;
And, if its pages keep you warm,&lt;br/&gt;
consider that scholastic charm.&lt;br/&gt;
Let it lull you to your sleep&lt;br/&gt;
and be the reason that you weep.&lt;br/&gt;
Be it the sword that it's the stone,&lt;br/&gt;
be it the marrow in your bone.&lt;br/&gt;
There enchantment in your blood;&lt;br/&gt;
your raft is readied for the flood!&lt;br/&gt;
All that we reach or read&lt;br/&gt;
is but a way that we'll be freed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I stand amid the page--&lt;br/&gt;
but is it space or middle age?&lt;br/&gt;
The setting matters not&lt;br/&gt;
so long as there's a plot&lt;br/&gt;
that widens out your road,&lt;br/&gt;
draws the burden from your load;&lt;br/&gt;
Be not slowed--be not slowed!&lt;br/&gt;
Oh pen! You write the ending;&lt;br/&gt;
on your point I am depending.&lt;br/&gt;
Oh pen! My inked flag's waving;&lt;br/&gt;
will you not be my saving?&lt;br/&gt;
Is all that we reach or read&lt;br/&gt;
but a way that we'll be freed?</content>

Personal Biz - Cold as Ice&lt;br/&gt;
(A Tale of Lord Silas Quick)&lt;br/&gt;
By:  K.L. Miller&lt;br/&gt;
13 May 2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Ringtones;  useful to ID a Caller before you look at the cell/Smart Phone... and my Blood Brother calling is definitely worth a Pause in our Session;  it even intrigues my Second, enough that once released from her Restraints she immediately vacates the room, giving me Personal Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"Jake!!  Long Time!!!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"You too Psy;  wish this was Jaw-Jackin'... but... Personal Biz."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;b&gt;THAT&lt;/b&gt; meant Face-Off...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* * * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	And for the Love of God... a Face-to-Face Meeting is the &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; way for &lt;b&gt;anyone&lt;/b&gt; to ask someone to Teach their kid about the Lifestyle... &lt;b&gt;when the kid is Sixteen!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Of course... once I heard his son's Tale... I had to agree:  Dad was &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; the one to go to on this one;  Jasper's first Girlfriend was a cutter.  And Jasper, frustrated, lashed out at her during sex once... and without even knowing or Understanding the Sleeping Demons within them both... Down the Rabbit Hole they went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Hey... give Dad &lt;b&gt;mad&lt;/b&gt; Credit;  he not only knew when he was out of his element, he knew where to go with this... and Who to Trust.  Some Social Worker would twist everything to make him out to be a bad Single Dad... &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a guy going through a messy divorce trying to raise his kid to respect Females;  of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; there's gonna be some duplicity there;  his Ol' Lady &lt;b&gt;cheated&lt;/b&gt; on his ass every chance she got!!!  With whoever was willing!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	I listened as Jasper vividly described not only the Moment of Crossing Over, but the &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; Moment when, as he described it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"I got Cold.  Everywhere... inside... outside... even my &lt;i&gt;thoughts&lt;/i&gt; seemed frozen, Sub-Zero..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Cold in the Sauce... when a Dom has Lost Control to the Beast Within... and suddenly, is Human again;  when he looked up at me, he expected to see laughter... not the Ancient Wisdom of a &lt;b&gt;practicing&lt;/b&gt; Dom who knew all too well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"It's natural to curl up into Fetal Position when left Cold in the Sauce, Jasper;  tell me... did she hold you afterwards?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"No... she was in the same position on the other side of the bed..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	I raised one eyebrow, swinging my head oddly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"What's up Silas?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"You Opened a Door within her as well I'm afraid;  if I'm even &lt;i&gt;remotely&lt;/i&gt; correct... the Pain you gave her eclipsed Cutting... so much so that she scurried away from you, confused, Pleasured... Peaceful... and utterly terrified;  just as you were..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"Cold in the Sauce," Jasper whispered;  I knew he wasn't thinking about himself; as with all Curious Minds, he was more concerned about WHAT he'd done to HER, examining each nano-tick with the care a Film Editor gives a Major Blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	I watch him... and Remember my own Awakening;  Jasper may not have my Gift, but he was doing his damned level best to crawl inside his Lover's Mind... figure out Why... What... How...;  I &lt;b&gt;envied&lt;/b&gt; him... because he had the Mundane Struggle;  all I have to do is &lt;i&gt;THINK IT&lt;/i&gt; and I have the Answer... ripped from her mind.  True... he only has guess-work and assumption to go on, but so does every other schlub tryin' to Figure Females Out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* * * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"So.  Am I Clear, Doc?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"The only thing you're guilty of is not being paranoid enough to brow-beat your Son into dating someone you hand-selected to bounce off his dick and spit out the Second Gen, chummer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	He sighed... then came &lt;b&gt;The Pause.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	See... he's fully Aware of My Gift... and right now, even without me prying into his Thoughts, he's considering having me &lt;i&gt;FIX&lt;/i&gt; his son... fix it so that Jasper wanders &lt;b&gt;away&lt;/b&gt; from the Lifestyle.  Only problem is... he's already &lt;i&gt;seen to it&lt;/i&gt; that his Son is less likely to go so far Under than &lt;i&gt;Jasper&lt;/i&gt; won't Exist within that now-growing Human Frame.  The Conflict comes from his &lt;b&gt;own&lt;/b&gt; staunch Belief in Free Will...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"What do I &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;, Bro?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"You Be &lt;b&gt;DAD...&lt;/b&gt;;  not &lt;i&gt;Father&lt;/i&gt;;  that means Strict and Rules;  &lt;b&gt;DAD&lt;/b&gt; has this in his corner:  Been There, Run That."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"But I haven't..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"Yep, but you knew where to go to get him Solid Information... &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; blatherskite, bulldrek or, worse, False Truth or Bible Thumpin'."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Jake laughed heartily, shaking his head;  he knew I was right... but it still shocked him that he, the self-proclaimed Consummate Fuck-Up... managed to Get This One Right;  Single Dad ain't easy... Single &lt;b&gt;PARENT&lt;/b&gt; ain't easy... but it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; a sad Norm.  So, naturally, some are gonna Get it Right... or as Right as &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be... if you wanna &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;JUDGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"If you want vindication... consider this:  he went from Self-Absorbed about being Cold in the Sauce to &lt;i&gt;utterly concerned about what he'd &lt;b&gt;done to her...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;;  that comes from Within... and being taught to Consider Others... and &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; came from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Arthur/Arcturus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"Ya done &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; chummer;  allow yourself at &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; a breather for a nano-tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"The really &lt;b&gt;BIG QUESTIONS...&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	"Come after he's Chosen his Path... I Remember the Lore, Old Wolf."  He chuckled wryly...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	I agree;  didn't make Raising a Teenager one damned bit easier in the end;  if I Thought about it... I could actually &lt;b&gt;tell&lt;/b&gt; him which of his hairs was going to go gray &lt;b&gt;just from this one MEET!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	(five... if you're curious)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;fin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CHALLENGE ACCEPTED, BITCH</title>
    <content type="html">*Click*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: This has been a very awkward week.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: (Looks at the recorder suspiciously.) Yes... Yes it has... What's with the Peacemaker? ((We call the recorder the peacemaker... Don't ask.))&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: You've gone soft.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: Pardon?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: You've. Gone. Soft.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: Want to die?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: I mean your writing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: My life is too full of shit to write about just one thing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: I have the perfect topic for you to write about.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: ... I don't like this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: N. We've all heard about her over and over, I think it's time you finally explained her.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G:  It's not even a good story. It's barely cute. Nobody would want to read it. Hell, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; don't want to read it. Compared to Inny, N's story is kind of a downer and a snoozefest.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: Well, I know you. And when you get &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; irrate and emotional, you write enough to make George Orwell shit his pants. And you do it pretty good. N still gets to you. Every time you see her, it's like all your circuits get fried and you start acting all sorts of fucked up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: "Pretty well." &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: Whatever. I have a proposal.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: ... Go on...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: If more than 5 Codexed members comment, you have to tell the story about N.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: I doubt it'll work.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A: Chicken...?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
G: Go fuck yourself. (Fires out a hand to shake.) CHALLENGE ACCEPTED, BITCH!

Throw the stone first,&lt;br/&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But in the end, just like any Full House episode, I learned a valuable lesson (Complete with poignant orchestral music) in friendship, humility and the problems that come with lying your ass off.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://whoregagger.codexed.com/2011/05/11/the-car-pt-1"&gt;WhoreGagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most other people felt something I didn't. And I find that a bit unsettling.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ashling.codexed.com/2011/05/11/emotional-processing-fail"&gt;Ashling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&#8217;ve finished growing up now, more or less. Now it&#8217;s time to be grown up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://mewithmyumbrella.codexed.com/2011/05/10/between-studenthood-and-real-lifehood"&gt;MeWithMyUmbrella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, I'm happy for you. The bit that burns is the fact that I cannot tell you this, because you will not deign to hear.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://withgreatzeal.codexed.com/2011/05/04/oh-shit"&gt;WithGreatZeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that red light flashing above your head was a good warning signal; it's just too bad I'm colorblind.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;A href="http://onesentencestories.codexed.com/2011/04/25/april-24th-2011"&gt;OneSentenceStories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am amazed that as a race of beings that all start out at the same place, and finish at the same place, we are so diversely unique. So many paths of pain and joy, so many faces of belief used to get to the end. yet no matter the road, emotions, or moral choices we still all end in the end.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bellwether.codexed.com/2011/05/08/untitled"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so simple of a thing to write about, heartbreak. Straightforward, really. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://k-kosa.codexed.com/2011/05/04/this-will-probably-not-make-much-sense-but-at-least-its"&gt;K-Kosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a place we have taken for granted; learn that it cannot be altered, only worked with and endured, the way river fish endure their wintry sleeves of ice. What matters, they say, is learning to live as a guest in this remarkable house that we&#8217;ve all inherited.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pine.codexed.com/2011/05/09/3-swimmer"&gt;Pine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I am going to learn how to stand in front of an orchestra, wave my wand, and create magic.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://moo.codexed.com/2011/05/10/magic"&gt;Moo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did my dreams of saving the world, saving the planet, creating public art and building communities fall?&lt;br/&gt;
Did I leave it on the plane, did I drop it in the ocean? Cause all I see in the mirror is wasteful disappointment with long brown hair.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://abstract.codexed.com/2011/05/05/two-years-in-the-making-why-am-i-here"&gt;Abstract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I suppose that it&#8217;s enough to be able to appreciate a spirituality without needing to ascribe to it, I do sometimes wish that I were wired to believe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://etymology.codexed.com/2011/05/08/shrine-maiden"&gt;Etymology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also consider the possibility that, if not already, then one day, he will play songs - maybe even those songs - for someone else. Or that one day he wont play anything at all&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://play_dead.codexed.com/2011/05/07/white-flag"&gt;Play_Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the youngness stems from the fact that I was about to move and start all over again. And maybe that's exactly why I feel so old now.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://monsterballads.codexed.com/2011/05/07/dreams-come-singing"&gt;MonsterBallads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the various yous in my past:&lt;br/&gt;
I miss us.&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>another try at this</title>
    <content type="html">I don't want to come off as pompous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I'd like to come across as capable. I have become capable, I will say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Tell me about yourself, said the statement prompt. Tell me why medicine for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I am a creative person with strong analytical skills. My fiance says that I am the most perceptive person he knows. I understand the slight movements of hands and facial features, coupled with a keen sensitivity to word choice. It's confidence, not arrogance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Dear AMCAS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The story of why medicine, and why now, starts in a suburban house in Michigan. It was January of 2008, and I was home from college an hour away, visiting. My older sister would soon move to San Diego as a response to the renewed rumblings of layoffs in the auto industry. I had interviews for phd programs in the coming weeks. At dinner my mother displaced some anger at my sister leaving The Company (we were an auto industry family) onto me and my pending out of state studies. I reminded her that this had been in the works for months, now. We tried to enjoy being together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Afterward, my childhood dog, a border collie, sat with me on the floor. This dog had been with my family since the summer I had a bike accident, through the healing of my broken hand, my parents' move to England after my high school graduation, and back again. As a teenager I naiively promised her that when I went to med school I'd take her with me. She was like a fourth sister, with an often comical youngest sibling rivalry to match. She used to whine in the same pitch as my complaining little sister to gently mock her. Her intelligent brown eyes looked sad now - such a sensitive creature knew when deep change was coming - and for a moment I was certain that this was the last time our family would be intact. I sank my fingers into the silky black fur of her ruff and together we sighed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Two weeks later, a few days before my only medical school interview, my parents let me know that the dog had been hit by a car in the fog and was dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For the rest of the semester I was grim with grief, but persisted to finish my degree. To my surprise, I was accepted to three phd programs and one medical school. And to everyone's surprise, I matriculated at the university of wisconsin grad school, where my lab supervisor had gotten his doctorate. And after I made that choice, my older sister and I gave my parents a puppy. I was deciding things on impulse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

That fall the economy crashed, and my family no longer worked for the auto industry. I thanked my lucky stars for fellowships, and worked hard to be the best scientist in my cohort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's been a good experience, this scientific training. The impulse to keep learning and collect empirical evidence is at the foundation of modern medicine. I finally developed time management skills that I'd been scraping by without during all of undergrad. I mastered knowledge about neuroscience, a subject I had very little background in, which expanded my understanding of techniques and scientific analysis. It also was a time when I developed skills for coping with a great deal of stress, and how to manage interpersonal conflicts and group work dynamics, which I know will be useful for the rest of my life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Ultimately my experience in graduate school made me a better person, though the growth I went through is a common metamorphosis from earnest student to responsible professional. I got a dog, a nearly feral rescue mutt who needed a home with a patient individual willing to learn her quirks and guide her to being a more social animal. And a little bit after the learning curve leveled off, when &lt;strike&gt;I was no longer struggling to set up experiments with incubations that fell during class lectures, and &lt;/strike&gt; I had a handle on my thesis work, lab duties, scholar community commitments, paying bills and keeping my dog sane, I realized that I would be unsatisfied by a purely academic research career.  Up until then I hadn't had spare time, but when it appeared I spent it reading about medicine and the art of doctoring. I gravitated toward Atul Gawande's articles, and re-read Richard Seltzer's books on surgery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Suddenly out of my happiness I was remembering my passion for medicine.  I talked with my thesis advisor, and she urged me to decide on a career path as soon as possible. Reflection only confirmed that if I was to be a scientist the work must have clinical relevance. But instead of trying to transfer into an MDPhD program, I want to wholeheartedly pursue an MD and become a physician. I wrapped up my research and wrote a Master's thesis, which I defended in April. Right now I'm looking for jobs near healthcare to prepare insights for my future in it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It all comes down to living a good life. Medicine is a special field, one that reminds us to ask what a good life looks like. It's a question doctors ask their patients, and then both do what they can to try to attain that good life. It's a question I ask myself, and the answer is: I will be happy based on my own attitude. But a good life to me includes satisfying work, knowing that my efforts are making a difference in the lives of others. I like working in teams, and I have good manual dexterity. As someone with lab background, I know I like being on my feet all day. And my problem solving skills and love of learning will be well exercised in the medical profession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At the beginning of the story I was afraid of change. Having learned to act like an adult, I'm looking forward to growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;

    <title>Fears preventing me from starting a dress making business</title>
    <content type="html">1)not enough time/energy- though it&#8217;s really about organization and time management, as we heard earlier in the week. between job searching and applying to med school, I fear that my creative time is finite and I&#8217;m spreading myself too thin, such that I won&#8217;t be doing anything well and screw up my chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

2)Is what I want to offer actually valuable? Is it sustainable? I want to make wedding gowns for socially conscious brides who desire luxury fabrics (sustainably sourced), classic couture design and quality sweat-free construction. It might be too difficult for me to continue this business after this year, so is it worth starting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3) I&#8217;m not a business person. I actually almost replaced &#8220;business&#8221; with &#8220;idea&#8221; in the last like of 2 because I think it&#8217;s not worth calling a business because surely I&#8217;ll fail and simply have wasted a bunch of money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ugh what ugly fears. No wonder I&#8217;m having a hard time. How do I get rid of them? Affirmations? (haha seriously, affirmations?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



    Now how to fix it.&lt;br&gt;

    1)If I set concrete goals I will know when I&#8217;m achieving them or not. Which can indicate whether I am &#8220;spread too thin&#8221;. Maybe there is no limit to how creative a person can be in a week. How will I know if I don&#8217;t try? And past evidence shows that I am really good at organizing my time/energy if I make it a priority. While it is easy to coast and waste time throughout the day, it can be almost as easy to stick to a well defined list, you just have to know when you&#8217;re in the best mindset to write the list.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    2) Of course it is a valuable product. And I will find out whether I can keep doing it with a full-time job as well. If I just underpromise and overdeliver I can&#8217;t screw it up, I can just pull back on orders. Besides, it&#8217;s an interesting project, and I could learn a lot from the experience. So, worth doing even if it&#8217;s temporary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    3)If I&#8217;m uncomfortable calling it a business, if that for whatever reason triggers fear, I don&#8217;t have to. I can call it a project. And I don&#8217;t have to be a business person to sell things I make. I can be an artisan.</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Woke up with the intention of going places today, but after showering, we decided that today was a day for lying around with pizza and Eddie Izzard's stand-up comedy, and for naps and laughter and tickling. So that's more than sufficient for me. Now we're winding down the night at work. More plans for tomorrow are being formulated, as are plans for the coming days. I am so excited. I can hardly think of coming home in two and a half weeks yet--things are going to be so strange when I step off the plane and I'm back in Florida, but I won't ever regret having come out here. Everything is exactly as it should be, and I'm incredibly pleased with this.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Odyssey</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an incredibly busy today, and incredibly productive, too. We got up pretty early to go and have C's car looked at (we'll have to go back on Thursday way early in the morning to drop it off), then went and had lunch, and began an adventure to find her a new pair of shoes. It took forever to find any that were actually suitable, but once we had secured that goal, we wandered through a mall, eventually went and saw Water for Elephants (really pretty good), and then headed home. We cooked together and spent the remainder of the evening watching through The Borgias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days off like this are days I can really get used to. Next week, we'll have time to have adventures every day, and I'm more than a little excited for that. It's been incredible so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

around your wrist, and left our duly&lt;br/&gt;
diseased hearts by a coil of a chain &lt;br/&gt;

We never rested, never tended, never &lt;br/&gt;

ground only as far as our false feet&lt;br/&gt;
would carry us, ending as the forward &lt;br/&gt;

to me, the only way to knowledge--and &lt;br/&gt;
knowing doesn't seem to introduce &lt;br/&gt;
itself as the detriment it really is. Tough&lt;br/&gt;
as it is, it fits.  I can't conjure a more&lt;br/&gt;

I want to get away from you.&lt;br/&gt;
As far and deep as I can be.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And it's funny because I know I'm escaping you.&lt;br/&gt;
But there are these fibers, these threads, the smallest links that keep me attached some how to you.&lt;br/&gt;
No matter how mad I get, how pissed off and enraged I become, I can't break these tethers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But I will.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Even if it means changing my phone number.&lt;br/&gt;
Moving out of state.&lt;br/&gt;
Jumping a ferry to the next country over.&lt;br/&gt;
Or being a stowaway on the next ship across the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That's how far I'm willing to go.&lt;br/&gt;
Because each time you try to get close to me again, I feel these chains get heavy.&lt;br/&gt;
As if someone's buried my escape tunnel so I have to start over again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Don't talk to me.&lt;br/&gt;
Please stay away from me. It's how I am.&lt;br/&gt;
And how I am no longer needs to be a part of you.&lt;br/&gt;
It's none of your business. It's none of your concern.&lt;br/&gt;
Just like how you are is none of mine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Release me.&lt;br/&gt;
So I can release you.&lt;br/&gt;
I want the rest of my life without traces of you.&lt;br/&gt;
Because I feel like I deserve that freedom.&lt;br/&gt;
And in turn, you can have all yours.</content>

    <title>A Cripple's Chant  </title>
    <content type="html">This is a worm of a poem.  It&lt;br/&gt;
inches along in the tract of&lt;br/&gt;
my thorax, throbbing with&lt;br/&gt;
the thrum of a drum--and&lt;br/&gt;
that is a feeling that so many&lt;br/&gt;
thrill seekers fancy--the draw,&lt;br/&gt;
the call of raw emotion that&lt;br/&gt;
evokes the first jump, the just&lt;br/&gt;
gesticulation of one artist&lt;br/&gt;
to another.  So take me down,&lt;br/&gt;
measure me up; count my&lt;br/&gt;
goodness by the length of my&lt;br/&gt;
lines.  So long as I have the&lt;br/&gt;
solace of my sonnets, I'll be fine.  </content>
