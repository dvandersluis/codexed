    <title>Untitled</title>
    <content type="html">I have fallen for you, violently. It only seems fair to let you know, fair to let you prepare, though it might be obvious. To me, it feels so obvious. A meeting between your being and mine feels correct in a way that makes my soul sigh, and I know I can't help it because your good vibrations reverberate my core, somehow I always fall so quickly. I hope it never seems insincere. I can tell you might not believe, I might not believe me in your place, I know, I have a hard time sometimes believing you, that you're falling too. I have a hard time sometimes believing in myself because sometimes, sometimes it's so dark in here it's hard to see what you see, but you see me even when we're just blind hands fumbling each other in the dark. I'm always fumbling. Sometimes I worry that my edges are too sharp. That this world has cast the stone that finally shattered my bruised pride, mind, heart. But I can believe in the you that believes in me. I speak the words that I believe in me into my heart, over and over a mantra of waves crashing against my souls stagnation, fear of the start. That bitter salt sea doesn't often taste true but your lips hold a spring that is fresh, and sweet, and deep; if I drink enough from your lips do you think I can wash this salt crust sea brine self doubt out of me? No, that's not how people work, I know, I've never been the type to believe in a savior. This is not a prayer for Redemption. I know no one can save me but me but maybe this is a start, another step in the process of becoming a part instead of apart. I know, sometimes, I get so silent it can be hard to see me there, but the quiet choking my throat is the pearl my heart built around whatever little sand grain made it scared. If ever I've loved you, I am sorry. I am sorry for the terror that keeps me apart because I would love nothing more than to be a part of something with you, something encompassing, something larger than you and me and we, a sum much larger than the sum of our parts. I've spent so long just trying to break out, and every pearl fractures, every step forward releases another hundred thousand grains of sand onto this desert, salt parched throat. And I'm wondering about feelings that have been felt by a hundred thousand others a hundred thousand times before, and the nature of authenticity, and if this, if these feelings, if it's not unique to me, does the story still bear repeating? Not a special snowflake, just another piece of humanity struggling with how or if to tell you about the grief inside my bones, the mania that makes my mind race, the anxious bird that beats itself against my inner ribcage trapped by the pearls piling into precarious mountains overhead. This doesn't end with an answer, there is no resolution. Just a quiet me, looking at you. </content>

    <title>Say Something</title>
    <content type="html">I spent years buried beneath the chokeweed chasers &lt;br/&gt;
drowning where the Ortho began to gather &lt;br/&gt;
in pools of where the lush green dropped &lt;br/&gt;
barren became the ground around the wellspring&lt;br/&gt;
droughted up, so I covered up&lt;br/&gt;
in jade green wondering at the sickened wasteland&lt;br/&gt;
in which we wander, wondering at how all the new&lt;br/&gt;
shiny perfection was just amalgam boiled horse&lt;br/&gt;
glue and chipped wooden forest extinction &lt;br/&gt;
to build hollow core doors, furniture that melts&lt;br/&gt;
like Dali's paint, no substance to stand in the progression&lt;br/&gt;
of time. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And I wonder if I am jaded green hollow cored &lt;br/&gt;
and empty, if I have dug out while scouring &lt;br/&gt;
the chokeweed, while looking for lost words, the essence--&lt;br/&gt;
what caused them to be in the first place, progenitor in absence&lt;br/&gt;
so I reach for what feels solid, brick, lathe, mortar and oak &lt;br/&gt;
because somewhere I gave away the whisperings of hope</content>

    <title>Yes, I think we've met before.</title>
    <content type="html">How can I begin to construct the bridge&lt;br/&gt;
when the slats sit upon opulent&lt;br/&gt;
space between the place where I&lt;br/&gt;
I was incandescent, argent pansophy &lt;br/&gt;
&#233;lan-dipped words draped honeyed tongue--&lt;br/&gt;
and here&lt;br/&gt;
where hulking, silent boulders of foundation &lt;br/&gt;
are dropping, seabed reaching to embrace&lt;br/&gt;
and phosphorescent denizens will greet&lt;br/&gt;
and the waters breaking over, cover over&lt;br/&gt;
and rise to meet the riven shoreline where&lt;br/&gt;
our building ceased&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Where I does not exist, to break&lt;br/&gt;
the tenant to not harm, do what you will--&lt;br/&gt;
it will fade, swim only in shoal waters&lt;br/&gt;
where mine abates&lt;br/&gt;
and wanting cannot matter.</content>

    <title>Lovesong II</title>
    <content type="html">Do you think that I put on sometimes I watch my hand shake&lt;br/&gt;
it quakes over a bowl of milk and eggs sometimes this inner tremble&lt;br/&gt;
becomes more lease than I'd afford. Washed over because the tide turns&lt;br/&gt;
unrelentless undertow in any act of days where I cannot take the stage&lt;br/&gt;
creep to an exit of stage left or stage right in hopes &lt;br/&gt;
that I am still closer to a yes than gone. Sometimes I can&lt;br/&gt;
I sit in greened sunshine with cookies books and we to watch &lt;br/&gt;
Sunday slip by sometimes, sometimes I cannot see&lt;br/&gt;
where this is going--do I dare to eat a peach? I sometimes slip&lt;br/&gt;
from my knowing, each to each. Sometimes I just breathe danger&lt;br/&gt;
when there's echoing and sound sometimes I cannot listen &lt;br/&gt;
when the world rushes in and drown. Will there be time, will there be&lt;br/&gt;
time for when I am out from under, time for tea and cakes&lt;br/&gt;
or moments past their crisis. I grow old I grow numb--&lt;br/&gt;
I have seen the triumph of my mind undone in little worlds&lt;br/&gt;
that separate the you from me in every thoughtless count&lt;br/&gt;
and recount of the unkept tally. Is there debt for what was done&lt;br/&gt;
or should you write off anything from minds who can only run?</content>

    <title>Only once gets through, then gets scattered by the rain.</title>
    <content type="html">Sometimes I have a tremendous sensation that I'm doing it all wrong, usually at times where I notice how I'm simply throwing myself at the terrible glass wall of my anxiety in attempts to do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. I flail and splash in silence, drowning as the spring of potential wells up beneath me, overflowing until all I can do is scrabble, hopelessly, against the cool, transparent border between inaction and creation, as unable to drown as break through. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There is more, there is more, there is a formless shape in the darkness inside of me trying to claw its way out of my chest&lt;/i&gt;--I could release it, but all my means, all my great works of life come up lacking in skill. We've been pressed with the bill, and the clerk has noted, simply, in a small script in the corner, insufficient funds. Without a means of creating our own release, we stumble on the words, trip over incomplete lines, skin knees on blotches of color and the sharp edge of the paper. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have the means, but the road is blocked, or lost within the tempest hurricane that swirls and strews refuse and debris across the path. A little dog with a dustpan brush face is sweeping away what led us so far into these woods. No breadcrumbs, no shining pebbles; then, going back was never an option. All that can happen is continuing on, because from the centre of what we are, the only place to move is out. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To that end, experience everything. To fight the winds we've traveled, we will outrun--is it a temporary solution? Is it escapism? A grandiose mistake? A step in the right direction, mayhaps a step towards... ? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Out. Outside, beyond the wall of winds, beyond the glass, there is a place where I will pour forth all the hot words that come now in fits and starts, short little bursts of truth that scant offer relief. I will resolve us into one. I have stepped out from the eye, the false calm of security into a thrust of unknown, terror, change; even if I return, nothing will be the same, the game has begun. What happens now will cause cracks, frigid pool of immobility to one side, the burning flood of &lt;i&gt;something more&lt;/i&gt; trying to press through will transform it into a torrent of Dutch tears, replete in tensile stress. Even this thick glass will shatter, and if I cannot stop the winds, I have become enough to stand up to the shrapnel of shards I will create. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So sayeth the king. </content>

    <title>Like a hurricane. </title>
    <content type="html">In a small way, I was afraid of why you'd come. So much of life is wrapped in expectation, so much that effort is kept minimal unless &lt;i&gt;something else&lt;/i&gt; is to be gained. Lassitude laced into the fabric of our lives, where action is saved for selfish intention. You didn't come to dash to bits the sea wall, roll a gale over it, forced summer storm while I washed out to sea. In a way maybe I was trying to see if I would break, or maybe I wanted to break someone against me. In spite of that, I kept burning the lighthouse. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Something else was gained in the calm that swept the water, something else spoke in the crash of waves on the beach. Something more, because it was less. What I lit was not doused, did not flicker in the startling calm of the air. Yet it stirred. I felt the flame grow hungry, and hot, and strangely content. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These words feel clumsy, feel small and misplaced; gone the confidence of craft, the swift skill of smithy. They drop, syllable by syllable, heavy and intentioned into the cool, white space; spend hours swirling between realization and the dark corners of contemplation. They cling to the hem, hide behind skirts, shrink in the face of open appraisal. To speak a thing it to make it real, to write grants power--these words tremble in the act of realization because even now they are unsure of themselves. Pause. Write. Pause. &lt;br/&gt;

    <title>How can you be so impartial?</title>
    <content type="html">Bury it deep, this house has no foundation and there is nothing upon which these pillars could stand. They would topple, they would knock it all down, and your Ivory Tower is nothing more than a house made of cards, or smooth set of dominoes. Blank faced, no pips, thousands of tiles surrender in a musical clattering. Bury it deep, for you will upset the status quo. Three's company with no third wheel, and you shouldn't make something from nothing, least of all a denial. It's unexisting, you whisper to the void, you fall on ears deaf and dumb and unaware. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The problem is not knowing, you've let things settle, settled on the word busy and distractions and letting anything be enough, even when it isn't. Not quite. Not even if you'd like to be. Because you are unaware of where you're going, drifting but not cut loose. You let the silence reverberate through these hollow spaces, knock around and ricochet off the places that you've filled with other faces and words and events and it's not enough. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Except when it is. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This time you can't delay the conversation, this time you need to know. It's from unexpected places, but take your courage when and where you can find it. Swim, if you're done with floating, don't drown. </content>

    <title>Under ice.</title>
    <content type="html">These rooms are dim-lit that find&lt;br/&gt;
the places where I lie in quake,&lt;br/&gt;
wanting to wake&lt;br/&gt;
your even breathing,&lt;br/&gt;
tiptoe down the hall&lt;br/&gt;
to rouse fleeting answer&lt;br/&gt;
to question&lt;br/&gt;
my courage pales to ask.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To feel the space between&lt;br/&gt;
our never-touching limbs divide&lt;br/&gt;
into infinitesimal fractions,&lt;br/&gt;
round to nothing&lt;br/&gt;
the amount of what's between&lt;br/&gt;

cry for conquest over how I cannot&lt;br/&gt;
how I limp with crippled limb&lt;br/&gt;

these dreams don't cease.&lt;br/&gt;

Too long between breathing, &lt;br/&gt;
gasp, wait,&lt;br/&gt;
tread under ice&lt;br/&gt;
watching for a hole,&lt;br/&gt;
headway or pocket&lt;br/&gt;
in which we can surface.&lt;br/&gt;
Wait, for strong arms to conquer &lt;br/&gt;
make-believe, to pull me down&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Not leaving you.</title>
    <content type="html">To or not? To quench &lt;br/&gt;
the ardor that these flames impel, &lt;br/&gt;
from incandescent thought found &lt;br/&gt;
nowhere in the camberous&lt;br/&gt;
lines of your breast, &lt;br/&gt;
or lithe hands that snake&lt;br/&gt;
my spine counting vertebrae.&lt;br/&gt;
No, this is for a far off cold that calls &lt;br/&gt;
with voices&lt;br/&gt;
from a distant star, &lt;br/&gt;
where even our most instantaneous&lt;br/&gt;
transmissions must count out four-&lt;br/&gt;
hundred-and-twenty seconds between&lt;br/&gt;
of complete void,&lt;br/&gt;
it lacks even the air we breathe.&lt;br/&gt;
To be closer to something&lt;br/&gt;
other than what we are, to go beyond&lt;br/&gt;
the limits of what is known.&lt;br/&gt;
Not to be leaving you, but to be&lt;br/&gt;
just as gone.</content>

    <title>Before there was you.</title>
    <content type="html">In soft-lit rooms I wait past the precipice&lt;br/&gt;
of earthly hours for congregation&lt;br/&gt;
past the hollowed out nest-home&lt;br/&gt;
of where I should stop, &lt;br/&gt;
refuge my sleep&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Here I sit in song for your deaf&lt;br/&gt;
heart--silent singing of movement&lt;br/&gt;
songs with trebles written&lt;br/&gt;
in pen strokes of limbs, no&lt;br/&gt;
crescendo to be sung just the same&lt;br/&gt;
same note played once, and again&lt;br/&gt;
and again&lt;br/&gt;
without end-stop&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Again this need echoes down&lt;br/&gt;
the hallway between us, slightly&lt;br/&gt;
scuffed from bike tires &lt;br/&gt;
with unimagined stains on the carpet&lt;br/&gt;
where we stand sometimes while wishing&lt;br/&gt;
goodnights, depart to rooms a hairsbreadth&lt;br/&gt;
from being one&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Without stop my lingering hand&lt;br/&gt;
will pause, and wait on the curve&lt;br/&gt;
of your crooked arm, small&lt;br/&gt;
of your back, stubbled cheek&lt;br/&gt;
waiting&lt;br/&gt;
for invitation to conquer&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Inclusion</title>
    <content type="html">All of this sidestepping has left me in an unfamiliar place:  sore feet, throbbing toes, and no sense of direction to speak of.  This is when I think someone will rescue me, and I scream and I scrape and I scratch at the sky, but no one comes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And no one will.  </content>

    <title>Rough Returns</title>
    <content type="html">I just want to feel all of these things&lt;br/&gt;
that I think maybe it's easier not to&lt;br/&gt;
feel.  And if that's angsty of me, then&lt;br/&gt;
so be it.  I'm tired of sensing all of&lt;br/&gt;
these things in other people, of crashing&lt;br/&gt;
my lifeline against their dreams and &lt;br/&gt;
finding there is no horizon.  I just want &lt;br/&gt;
the fucking sun to remember to go down.</content>

    <title>You get what you need.</title>
    <content type="html">If I give in to the sadness, I lose. Each tear is a defeat, each hour spent in listless inaction bemoaning the loss puts me further away from where I mean to go. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have to remember the goal. Have to go on living with joy and life if I am to find joy and life later. If I break down, if I fall, I cannot hope to reach the top. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have faith in that last sad smile, the tears spilled in the midst of our parting in bed. That irrevocable, undeniable, completely natural attraction that would not let you simply &lt;i&gt;leave&lt;/i&gt;. You knew, and I knew, and we fell into each other like people drowning hold on to bubbles of air. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I understand why you cannot make those promises. If we are both to survive we have to swim back to the surface on our own strength, &lt;i&gt;Sauve Qui Peut&lt;/i&gt;, let him save himself who can.  You do not know what you will see at the surface. The ocean hides swift currents under its smooth waters, there is no telling where even you might come up. Or who you might have become when you do. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the end though, you touched your chest, you said, "You will always be here." And you will always be here, right here, wrapped up in my hope and belief and love. That is not a flower that I can water with despair, my saline tears would only salt the earth in which it grows. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have to water hope with joy, belief with faith, love with love. I have to know that the tides all move in patterns, they move with purpose, they move with scientific fact. I have faith that our lives will move with purpose, in the patterns that they must. I have faith that our coming together when we did was no mere accident, and that the purpose we forged together is not one that will go wasted. I believe that no matter where we surface, somehow the tides will see us together again. All we have to do is find up, and swim there. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can't always get what you want. </content>

    <title>Because of the color of the wheat fields.</title>
    <content type="html">I'm going to have to stay strong. Fewer tears, less time between my knees hitting the ground and standing back up. If there is a chance to be had, if there is hope, I will need to keep up. Match you, strength for strength. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you've said, this can't be easy for you either. Though I might not understand, though I can't stand next to you, I'll be there. It's the only place I can be, my love. Because above all else, I cannot give up. Love is patient. </content>

    <title>Let the wind erase me.</title>
    <content type="html">The phone rings, or I receive a text, and all I can do is let the small noises issue from the speaker as I fail to answer, fail to respond. I think it's cold. It must be. I'm sorry I can't tell you why.   &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We had back then an easy pace. Together we could while away hours, days, just talking talking talking until other obligations called, until my father picked up the other phone and said I was on too late, it was time to go to bed. I could long for that, for our hours of whispered words and laughter, the exhilaration of it all being so fresh. That's why. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When I left, you came with me in a way that transcended my loneliness and fear, you dulled the edges of my transition. You made it that much easier for me to step up to each day as it came. For me your help was a way to keep on being, because back then I didn't know the strength in me like I do now. I'm sorry I would not let myself be everything for or to you then that I should have, that my commitment was a day late and dollar short, but you know it wasn't through lack of wanting--it was the misguided morals of youth, the everlasting failure to know something until it is gone, the torn heart that of all people you should understand. That's why. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When you left I let myself think in ways I am not proud of, and spent years wanting to be something I despise. For a while it was time and situation and other people that helped us grow apart, but there were cracks in the glass wall between us, and through some of those enough of the old sense of ease and life slipped through to keep something there, to feed a small, ravenous, despairing hope. Feeding that hope kept me from feeding any other, let me put up with any other thing because &lt;i&gt;it didn't really matter&lt;/i&gt;. That's why. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"One only understands the things that one tames."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I don't know when it happened, but at some point I decided that I couldn't live like that anymore. That's why I can't always answer when you call, why I try and stay light and fluffy with the things I will say. Because at this point &lt;i&gt;I don't even know what you really want anymore&lt;/i&gt;, and I can't--I can't find out, can't know you, because if I don't know you I can't love you. So I have to let the phone go unanswered. I have to be light and casual and keep you at a distance. I couldn't keep up with letting the world float on around me, with not participating, trying to stay frozen for an unknown someday. I couldn't keep feeling that lonely. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Because you chose, and it was not me. Because I have stopped waiting. I had to stop waiting. It's been what, eight years? How long after that decision could I keep holding on? Yet I still can't banish the guilt. A small part of me, I think, will always want to know. I always struggle with not picking up the phone. But what can I say? The current tenor of our conversations, sparse as they are, frustrates me--but where can it go? How do you span the gulf caused by bridges burned?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you... "&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Then it has done you no good at all!"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
[...]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Goodbye," he said. "Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
