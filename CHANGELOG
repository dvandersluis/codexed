* The lorem entry now gets populated with some tags and categories. [#604]

Additions:
* Journal archives can now be viewed per year (/archive/2010), month (/archive/2010/10), or day (/archive/2010/10/26) [#19]

* [now] substitution added, which displays the current date/time (it can be given a format like [time]). [#612]

* It is now possible to navigate between archive pages, using the substitutions [archiveprev] and [archivenext]. If anything is given as a parameter, it is used as the link text (this can include [date] which will display the date of the prev/next archive).

* Codexed now will keep track of users' birthdays. A dismissable notice will be given to users who have not filled out their birthday. Something special will happen when it's your birthday! :) [#639]

* There is now a "Return to Options" link in the import journal summary page. [#350]
