= interpolated_time_formats

+interpolated_time_formats+ adds support for the interpolation of time/date
formats when generating strings with <tt>Time#strftime</tt> or <tt>Date#strftime</tt>.

== Description

Specifying the format of times and dates can sometimes be difficult if you want
to include more complex operations like ordinalizing the day.  For example,
suppose you want to create a string format that outputs the following:

  31st of Decemember
  5th of January
  2nd of February

In order to use this type of format, you would normally need to create a helper
method like so:

  def fancy_date(date)
    "#{date.day.ordinalize} of #{date.strftime('%B')}"
  end

However, this helper method would not be available everywhere within your
application unless the method was defined in the Object class.

The best way to approach this would be by adding additional formats through
<tt>Time::DATE_FORMATS</tt> in +ActiveSupport+ and the use of interpolation.

== Usage

  >> Time::DATE_FORMATS[:fancy] = '#{day.ordinalize} of %B'
  => "\#{day.ordinalize} of %B"
  >> Time.parse('12/31/2006').to_s(:fancy)
  => "31st of December"

Through the use of interpolation, <tt>day.ordinalize</tt> will only be evaluated when
+strftime+ evaluates the format.  As a result, in addition to using the
<tt>Time#strftime</tt> directives, you also get access to the local variables and methods
in the instance.

== Dependencies

This plugin does not depend on the presence of any other plugins.
