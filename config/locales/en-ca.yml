We call this the <i>public</i> feed. The second allows people to read public as well as password-protected entries (but private ones are still hidden). We call this the <i>private</i> feed. People gain access to the private feed through the feed key. As you can see this is a sequence of characters that appears at the end of the private feed URL and is randomly generated so as to prevent it from being guessed. This means that the people you give this URL to do not have to enter a password; however, the security risks are the same as a password. That is, there is no way to prevent specific entries from appearing in the private feed aside from hiding them completely from your journal, so be careful who you share this URL with. If you find out that someone has gotten a hold of the URL without your knowledge, you may choose to regenerate the feed key above. This will immediately prevent any new entries you create from appearing in the private feed, and requiring anyone who is subscribed to the feed to contact you for the new URL."
