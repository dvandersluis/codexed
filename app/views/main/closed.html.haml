          %h2 Codexed Closed for Server Move
          %p
            == As announced a week ago on the #{link_to "Forums", "http://forums.codexed.com/viewtopic.php?t=849"}, Codexed has closed down as of 4pm EST, 28 October 2008, in order to facilitate moving Codexed to its new server for the beta release. Because we are moving to a new server, with a new database, we have to close the service over the interim so that no data will be lost in the move (a snapshot of the database was taken when the service was closed, and this snapshot is what is being used for the new database; if we allowed the service to remain open in the interim, any changes made after that point would be lost when the beta opens). As such, the Codexed service will be unavailable until the beta opens on 30 October 2008. The forums, however, will remain open during that time, so please be sure to check them out if you haven't already. Any questions or concerns about the beta or the server move can be asked there as well.
          %p
            Thank you for your support of Codexed, and we hope to see you in the beta!
